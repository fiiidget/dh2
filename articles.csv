"b'December 21, 2011'","b'Occupy Wall Street found a new home on Dec. 6 \xe2\x80\x94 not a new park, plaza or square \xe2\x80\x94 but a house. Just weeks after the eviction from its encampment in the financial district, around 1,000 occupiers and local community members braved the rain to take a foreclosure tour of the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn, concluding with a celebratory block party as once-homeless community organizer Alfredo Carrasquillo, together with his wife and two children, reclaimed a vacant home (see photo essay, p. 2). It was one of many anti-foreclosure and anti-eviction actions taking place in communities across the United States that day.\n\tAs the march passed, I heard a local woman say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a long time coming.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\tFor those of us who have been organizing and reporting on Occupy Wall Street for the past few months, the afternoon was a reunion of familiar faces, of people who used to see each other daily at Liberty Plaza. But more visible than usual at Occupy Wall Street actions were collared clergy and members of the State Assembly and City Council. Together with locals and organizers from the NYC General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s Direct Action Committee, they were leading the marches and calling out the chants \xe2\x80\x94 all through the people\xe2\x80\x99s mic, of course, megaphone-free. Along the way, staffers from groups that were once anticipating from afar what Occupy Wall Street would do were now busily coordinating the action; among these were Van Jones\xe2\x80\x99 Rebuild the Dream, New York Communities for Change and Organizing for Occupation.\n\tThis, it seems, is our clearest glimpse yet of what Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPhase II\xe2\x80\x9d will look like.\n\tThe General Assembly and its related working groups are only able to do so much on their own. Without the focal point \xe2\x80\x94 or, to some, distraction \xe2\x80\x94 of an encampment, the movement\xe2\x80\x99s actions will rely more on coordinating with institutions that are firmly entrenched in neighborhoods where it works. Despite the Occupy movement\xe2\x80\x99s leaderless structure, this also means working with the leaders of these institutions.\n OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS\n\tWhile occupiers have almost always welcomed the support of outside organizations cheerfully, during the Occupy Our Homes march I heard grumbling among some who have had negative experiences with this or that public figure, or who are suspicious of traditional institutions as a whole. A City Council member might stand with the movement one day, but what will she expect from it on election day? And how far will a given nonprofit go with civil disobedience before it starts to scare away funders? These are new questions that the Occupy movement will have to face.\n\tThe answer, though, seemed clear to me when I passed an activist running from the soon-to-be-reclaimed house on Vermont Avenue with a drill in his hand \xe2\x80\x94 which presumably had been used to bypass the lock. With the march came a team from Occupy Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s sanitation committee to clean up inside the house. Outside, the occupation\xe2\x80\x99s library and kitchen set up shop, along with teach-ins and a pi\xc3\xb1ata. The answer I had in mind, that is, is direct action. As long as this movement keeps nonviolent acts of resistance at its center, refusing to wait for the powers that be to approve of the undertakings it deems necessary, it will be far less corruptible. Politicians and nonprofits will join the cause not so much because they see a comfortable opportunity for themselves but because they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford not to.\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what appears to be happening in Phase II, even more so than in Phase I. As occupations around the country are hardened by the experience of forced eviction, they\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be less receptive to the kind of coddling by politicians that took place in some cities early on. The spirit of direct action is spreading. David DeGraw of OWSNews.org told me that he was getting text messages from all over the country Dec. 6 like this: \xe2\x80\x9cI just removed a newly changed lock off of a house to let original owner back in. My Leatherman rules!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\tFurthermore, without the need to oversee encampment sites, the attention of Phase II is much more carefully oriented around the very means by which the movement\xe2\x80\x99s corporate opponents perpetuate themselves: foreclosed homes, ports and rampant consumerism. Foreclosures, as the ground zero of the 2008 financial crisis, are a fitting place to start. They\xe2\x80\x99re also where the often abstract machinations of Wall Street hit home for many Americans. By preventing them, or reversing them, the movement will find new allies who were less moved by the earlier talk of ending corporate personhood or imposing a Tobin tax. Many see this kind of work as an important next step in preparation for the spring and the challenges that will come with an election year.\n SPANISH LESSONS\n\tThis was a foregone conclusion for the May 15 movement in Spain, which has served as a source of inspiration to many Occupy Wall Street organizers. On Dec. 6, I talked about this with Monica Lopez, who is part of the Spanish movement and has been at Occupy Wall Street since the beginning. The Spaniards started doing anti-eviction work almost immediately, because families participating in the movement were facing eviction.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as a family got a notice that they were going to be evicted, we would all get ready to make an appointment for where we [were] supposed to go.\xe2\x80\x9d She flashed a mischievous smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWe showed up, hundreds of people, every single day that it was happening.\xe2\x80\x9d They eventually created a text message alert system, and anti-eviction actions continue to happen all over Spain.\n\tKnowing that some fear Occupy Wall Street might be in decline, I asked her whether this kind of work helped the Spanish movement grow after it was no longer occupying public squares. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah \xe2\x80\x94 how can it not keep growing? I mean, this is for everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d Lopez said.\n\tThat much was clear from the scene in East New York, where the movement\xe2\x80\x99s demographics suddenly shifted as it moved out of the financial district and into one of Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s poorest neighborhoods. Looking out over the crowd, Councilmember Ydanis Rodriguez observed, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the eviction, the movement has got more color!\xe2\x80\x9d Since Occupy Wall Street has often been accused of not being welcoming enough to those hit hardest by the recession and the resulting austerity measures, this difference means a lot.\n\tNew communities and new organizations, of course, mean new complications for an already messy movement. But if it can keep building momentum this way, by speaking and acting on behalf of people\xe2\x80\x99s most vital needs, it will always have a home somewhere.\nNathan Schneider is an editor at WagingNonviolence.org, where an earlier version of this article was published.\n'",b'\n',b'12/21/2011 - 7:54pm',"b'OWS might want to sing the same song, to the republican leaders, as the townspeople of ""Whoville"" after the Grinch stole their Christmas\n'","b'December 21, 2011'","b'\nWisconsin unionists are saying that a copycat attack on 191 Machinists at a crane-building company is one more reason to recall Governor Scott Walker, as if more were needed.\nTaking a cue from Walker\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that decimated public unions in the state, Manitowoc Crane is demanding an open shop and an end to dues checkoff, in a plant that\xe2\x80\x99s been union for at least 60 years.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want to Walkerize us,\xe2\x80\x9d says bargaining committeeman Gary Miller of Machinists Local 516, on strike since November 15.\nMiller said the company first wanted workers to vote every year whether their union would continue to exist, then proposed that at the beginning of each month each worker could choose.\nChristina Brey of the statewide teachers union called the language \xe2\x80\x9calmost identical\xe2\x80\x9d to Walker\xe2\x80\x99s bill that touched off last winter\xe2\x80\x99s rebellion that saw 100,000 march in Madison against the attack on bargaining rights.\nWisconsin unionists and thousands of others announced today they have gathered 507,000 signatures in four weeks in their drive to force Walker into a recall.

Farmers resent rules that will put Badgercare, the state\xe2\x80\x99s medical insurance program, out of reach for many. Anyone with children in school sees the effects of $1.6 billion in cuts to education. Brey says 4,000 fewer adults are working in Wisconsin schools now than last year.\nBecause state aid to localities was cut, local governments have slashed staff and services. In October, Wisconsin was the only state to lose jobs, 9,700 of them.\nJohn Matthews, executive director of the Madison teachers union, says people are steamed about Walker\xe2\x80\x99s violation of the state\xe2\x80\x99s ethos of \xe2\x80\x9cWisconsin nice\xe2\x80\x9d and outraged by the betrayal of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s legacy of progressive legislation. Wisconsin was the first state to let public employees bargain collectively, for example.\nWisconsin firefighters gathered December 3 to kick off their own petition-gathering, though firefighters and police are exempt from Walker\xe2\x80\x99s anti-union law.\nPresident Mark Sanders of the Ohio firefighters union told the group that though most fire stations there are tuned to Fox News, last winter\xe2\x80\x99s uprising in Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x9clit a torch in Ohio and now we are here to pass it back to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOhio firefighters played point in voters\xe2\x80\x99 massive turn-down of their own governor\xe2\x80\x99s anti-collective bargaining bill, in November.\nMatthews said police are enforcing the law against defacing petitions, a felony. One Walker backer who scribbled over a petition and drove off was arrested, as was another who tore up a recall sign.\n\n\t\tDIY Effort\nThe organization driving the petition-gathering, United Wisconsin, began as a website put up by one Appleton resident, Michael Brown, during the February-March revolt.\nToday the site lists 50 local offices.

Though many Democratic challengers are interested, that question is up in the air.\nSome pollsters say Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, whom Walker defeated in 2010, has the best chance to beat him because of his name recognition. But Cavanaugh says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have detected no enthusiasm from union folks for a Barrett candidacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOthers say Barrett was a \xe2\x80\x9cwet dishrag\xe2\x80\x9d during the 2010 campaign, turned down invitations to meet with union members, and has been hard on public workers in Milwaukee unions.\nAt a Steelworkers legislative conference December 2, some activists directed questions to \xe2\x80\x9cGovernor Erpenbach\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94state senator Jon Erpenbach, who was spokesperson for the 14 senators who left the state in February to block Walker\xe2\x80\x99s bill. Erpenbach, who has a near-flawless labor voting record, was point person in the senate for the state AFL-CIO\xe2\x80\x99s universal health care legislation.\nNational unions have not yet entered the fray, though they are sure to buy ad time once the election period begins. State law allows unlimited spending by either side, and the Koch brothers\xe2\x80\x99 Americans for Prosperity front group is likely to spend big.\nWalker began his TV ads during a Packers game the night before the recall petition was to be launched, featuring a school board member from a rich county praising the governor for giving her the \xe2\x80\x9ctools\xe2\x80\x9d to deal with tough times.\nUnionists believe that Walker is running scared. He does not appear in public in Madison, and when he travels in other parts of the state, he is met by picketers. His attempt to avoid demonstrators by moving the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in the Capitol to 8:15 a.m. was unsuccessful. Later, protesters unfurled a giant red Recall banner from the top balcony.\nIn Manitowoc, Gary Miller says his bosses should be worried that Walker will be recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might not be here to help them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThis article was originally published by Labor Notes.\n'",b'\n',b'12/21/2011 - 5:43pm',"b""The NRA has a lot of influence on gun owners in Wisconsin, making them call themselves Repulicans strictly for fear of losing their guns.

Target was one of hundreds of big box stores that opened their doors at midnight on Black Friday, with workers expected to clock in as early as 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving night. Happy holidays, Target employees.\nEvery holiday season America convulses in a spasm of consumer madness. Millions of people dash through malls, pushing and shoving to buy gifts on credit cards smoking with debt (the average amount of credit card debt is $6,513 per person, and this year the number of Black Friday shoppers who used their credit cards spiked from 16 to 27 percent). Fox News goes into hysterics about secularism. And after the buying, cooking, hosting and eating are over; we collapse, wiped out by the work as miles away bulldozers bury the leftover packaging, wrapping paper and unwanted gifts into landfills. This is Christmas.\nWhy do we this? What are we buying? On the surface, the holiday season\xe2\x80\x94 that magical time replete with the warmth of family and gifts \xe2\x80\x94 seems like it harkens back to a simpler time. And each time we purchase presents we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to recreate that very image \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re buying the experience of innocence.\nThe major holiday narratives \xe2\x80\x94 from The Christmas Carol and How the Grinch Stole Christmas! to the ritual of lying to kids about Santa Claus \xe2\x80\x94 revolve around reclaiming innocence or preserving it. Ebenezer Scrooge and the Grinch are moved by the selflessness of others to give away their stolen wealth. In both stories, the crucial scene is when they witness the very people they were trying to discourage and thwart celebrating pure communion with each other.\nYet before we mistake these scenes as radical moments of transformation, look again. In The Christmas Carol, lowly Bob Cratchit practices a form of class masochism by loyally working for Scrooge for years for a pittance. Cratchit only receives a Christmas turkey and a raise due to Scrooge\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, not because he stood up to his boss or went on strike. Not exactly progressive values. In How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, the Who\xe2\x80\x99s of Whoville are paragons of detachment. After the Grinch steals their presents they still circle the tree and sing. But what is missed is that they already bought their presents! Gift exchange could be completed in the absence of material goods because they always just signified an intangible ideal; yet they still had to buy the stuff to initiate the cycle of gifting. The Who\xe2\x80\x99s of Whoville are not exactly above crass consumerism.\nBut the real point is that The Christmas Carol and How the Grinch Stole Christmas! use the scene of the removed gaze. Both Scrooge and the Grinch suffer from a corrosive cynicism that erodes their relationships with others. Removed from view, they spy on others (either in a dream or from a cave) and are blinded by the blazing light of love, despite their best efforts to quash any semblance of happiness.\nAnd this unconditional giving is what we practice with our children. We provide them with gifts but tell them Santa brought it and watch from a removed gaze, experiencing giving without return. In that moment, we buy innocence back from our children.\nBut in the adult world, Christmas shopping takes a self-serving turn. In the stampeding shoppers we see the desire for innocence filtered through class anxiety \xe2\x80\x94 buying mid- to high-end commodities at reduced prices offers consumers both a jump in their social status and an increased dose of innocence, since the trappings of failure are never systemic but vigorously personalized.\nAnd that is the joy of Christmas morning; you can buy innocence for less than nothing. But what if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear cheery songs about Christ or see commercials advertising holiday sales? What if the holiday season was quiet? What would you do? It is hard to imagine because Christianity, along with the consumer ritual, have become so entwined with how we celebrate the holiday season. It is helpful to remember that Christmas wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always about children and materialist consumption. Nor was it always about Christ. For thousands of years, the Winter Solstice was a time of rowdy, drunken, lascivious merriment \xe2\x80\x94 and it took centuries of empire to erode these roots.\nTHE HISTORY OF CHRISTMAS\nDuring Christmas, Jesus is everywhere. Churches blaze with nativity scenes. If he existed, he most likely was born in the summer into the divided Judaic world of 1st century B.C. where anti-Hellenic Pharisees, wealthy Sadducees and the rebel Zealots vied for power. As an adult, he preached about forgiveness and an apocalypse that never came. Later, he kicked over the moneychangers\xe2\x80\x99 tables in the temple and was killed for causing trouble. The oral tradition of retelling his story continued for decades after his death and slowly became scripture.\nThe tiny circle of Jews who believed Jesus was the Messiah retroactively created his virgin birth. His nativity appears only in two of the four Gospels, first in Matthew (80-90) then Luke (75-100). Early Christianity was still under the sway of Judaism, as shown by the casting of Jesus as the new Moses in the Gospel of Matthew. As the religion grew, converted gentiles like Luke the Evangelist rewrote Jesus for a Hellenic world, and the Apostle Paul built a church on this myth. This image of a new world Messiah emerged and entered a crumbling Roman empire.\nPreaching from the city squares, early apostles drew the poor and middle-class in with their promises of deliverance and salvation. And they faced the sword for it. As devout monotheists in an empire built on polytheism, they were often scapegoats. In July 64 a great fire raged through Rome. Emperor Nero blamed the Christians, and Roman historian Tacitus wrote how they were, \xe2\x80\x9ctorn by dogs or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOver the centuries, Christianity went from an underground religion to a dominant force in the halls of power. In 312 Emperor Constantine gave credit to Christ for his victory in battle, and under him the church flourished. And it was Pope Julius I in 350 who set the date of Dec. 25 as the birthday of Jesus, which conveniently fell a couple days after the pagan Roman festival \xc2\xa0of Saturnalia. People could keep to their old ways as long as they covered it with a new, Christian face.\nNearly 2,000 years later, we are stuck with an annual global holiday dedicated to a radical rabbi who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born on that day and preached asceticism and apocalypse.\nTHE PAGAN ROOTS OF CHRISTMAS\nBeneath the snow-laced trees of Northwest Germany, swords clanged as men cut each other into red ribbons of meat. It was 772 and Emperor Charlemagne was on the war path. As he won battle after battle against pagan Saxons, crosses and churches sprung up in his wake. Christianity was the state religion and wherever empire went, it followed.\nFor champions of Christianity like Charlemange, Christmas served as a vehicle for bringing pagans into the fold. In the Germanic provinces, Winter Solstice was a ritual that celebrated life in the dead of winter. Yule logs were burned in hearths. Pine trees were decorated because of their evergreen quality. Animals were killed so as not to waste feed in the winter. Beer was drank. Merry-making broke out. Afterwards, tribes struggled to survive the freezing months of famine until spring.\nEach element of Winter Solstice was transformed into a staple of Christmas. The pine tree became the Christmas tree. The slaughtered pig was transformed into the Christmas ham. From the beer-chugging and bawdy singing came caroling. But for centuries the pagan wildness survived. In the High Middle Ages, it was a time of debauched revelry. In 1377, King Richard of England killed 28 oxen and 300 sheep for a giant feast. Rowdy bands of carolers prowled the streets. Sex and gambling spilled outside into full view.\nIn the 16th century the Protestant Reformation cleaved Christianity and soon Puritans condemned Christmas as a Catholic trap for wayward souls. The Catholic Church tried to steer the festivities toward somber ritual but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Pro-Christmas riots exploded and for a week the English city of Canterbury was lit red by fire and fighting. In Colonial America the war over Christmas continued. Puritans fined anyone caught celebrating it five shillings, while elsewhere in New York and Pennsylvania German immigrants celebrated it enthusiastically.\nAfter the American Revolution, English-tinged holidays like Christmas fell out of vogue. As if to show contempt for all things English, Congress even met and conducted business on Christmas Day. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until tensions between America and Britain eased that the holiday began its ascent in America. In 1822 the poet Clement Moore wrote A Visit from St. Nicholas, more commonly known as \xe2\x80\x99Twas the Night Before Christmas, which popularized gift exchange. Harriet Beecher Stowe, famous for Uncle Tom\xe2\x80\x99s Cabin, wrote A Christmas in New England in 1850, in which a character complains about the holiday\xe2\x80\x99s crass commercialism. But it was Santa Claus \xe2\x80\x94 jolly red-cheeked and slinging gifts from his reindeer-led sleigh \xe2\x80\x94 that brought Christmas to an unprecedented level of popularity in the early 20th century.\nChristmas became a federal holiday in 1870, but 141 years later it is again the site of cultural war. It\xe2\x80\x99s a yuletide ritual for Fox News to monitor the \xe2\x80\x9cWar on Christmas\xe2\x80\x9d or as they see it, the secularization of America\xe2\x80\x99s Judeo-Christian identity. Conservative groups like the Catholic League and the American Family Association threaten boycotts against Wall-Mart and Target, respectively, unless they put front and center that this is about Christ \xe2\x80\x94 not Allah, or Moses, or Santa Claus \xe2\x80\x94 but Christ.\nCHRISTMAS AND THE CAPITALIST CONVEYOR BELT\nThe global economy is a like a vast conveyor belt \xe2\x80\x94 and the great speedup comes at Christmas time. At the front of it, raw materials are drilled, mined, ripped and thrown on a belt that rolls into factories where Santa\xe2\x80\x99s elves go to work. Most of them happen to be Chinese; they make pink Christmas trees, blinking lights and toys, toys, toys.\nAnd nearly everything has bloody fingerprints on it. When we see Christmas commercials featuring jubilant songs and happy families unwrapping gifts, we are witnessing the whitewashing of the reality of production. This myth primes the pump of holiday spending, which accounts for a quarter of personal spending in the United States.\nSo Karl Marx was right. Behind the commodity fetish is a production hell. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the trash. At the end of the capitalist conveyor belt is a mountain range of garbage that grows and grows. Each year, Americans create 200 million tons of garbage.\nTake, for instance, the conundrum of the Christmas tree. Want to be more environmentally conscious and buy a fake tree? In 2010, 13 million artificial trees were sold in the United States. Even if you keep that fake tree for the rest of your life, it will take thousands of years to decompose, and the polyvinyl chloride (aka PVC\xe2\x80\x99s) used to make the tree release carcinogens into the atmosphere from the production line to the trash heap. What about a live tree? It takes 20 years to offset the carbon emissions of growing and transporting the tree, and of the 50 million trees purchased each holiday season, 30 million end up in landfills.\nAnd what of the plastic wrapping materials involved in packaging all of the gifts that go under the tree? Some of it finds its way to the Pacific Ocean creating a 100 million ton island of plastic, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. As it slowly degrades, the plastic transforms into smaller particles of polymer, which are gulped down by fish that we catch and eat, filling our bodies with cancer seeds that sprout death.\nBack on dry land, the holiday season also means that the pace of garbage production picks up by 25 percent \xe2\x80\x94 adding an extra million tons to the non-holiday average. The amount of greenhouse gasses also shoots up, due to an increase in travel. Christmas is a time when the death of the planet speeds up.\nBut this holiday season, there is a glimmer of hope. In spite of the commercials and consumerism and the myth of innocence, people are angrily camping out at Occupy sites and demanding work. They\xe2\x80\x99re taking over foreclosed homes and questioning the sanctity of capitalism. What if, in addition to re-imagining our society as a whole, we created a new vision of the holidays, too? We could peel off the centuries of capitalism and Christianity that have perverted the original meaning of the Winter Solstice. We could drink, eat and wear antlers and make love in the forest. And we could remember that the sun is returning, a day at time, to its former glory \xe2\x80\x94 and so can we.\n'",b'\n',b'01/02/2012 - 1:31am',"b""In regards to the Christmas Carol's Bob Cratchit, I think you are being a tad hard on him when you call him masochistic for working under Ebenezer Scrooge.

After several progressive legal outfits challenged the New York Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on keeping barricades around Zuccotti Park, the city took them down Jan. 10. Officials were no longer able to defend the selectively enforced and unwritten park rules that violated a special zoning permit that requires park owner Brookfield Properties to keep the space permanently open for the public benefit.\nThe victory is a reminder that in the four months of the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, it has relied on an army of legal supporters in the face of police repression and mass arrests. One such group is the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), which has been working around the clock, springing protesters from jail and documenting police tactics. The activist attorneys of the NLG are dedicated and well trained, but OWS has been a test like no other.\nGideon Oliver, head of the NLG\xe2\x80\x99s New York chapter, had a busy week during the Republican National Convention protests of 2004, in which 1,800 people were arrested. The 2004 RNC was a dramatic confrontation, but it lasted only a matter of days. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one expected such a long standing occupation,\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver said during an interview at his lower Manhattan office. \xe2\x80\x9cSince Sept. 17, we have increased our staff and volunteer legal workers.\xe2\x80\x9d More than 2,000 have been arrested in the city since the occupation began.\nBecause most OWS protesters who are arrested are charged with low-level offenses, the NLG is able to spring these people from jail with relative ease, with OWS working groups committed to setting aside money for bail. But, Oliver said, \xe2\x80\x9cMore and more of these cases are being charged as felonies,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable to expect there will be an increasingly high bail set.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NLG is, therefore, urging people to contribute either their time or money. It has a website devoted to this, at nlg.org/occupy.\nBut more than just being on hand to post bail, the NLG is playing a central role in trying to bring to light the systemic police violence against people exercising their First Amendment rights. Oliver pointed to the first famous case of NYPD excess in OWS: Anthony Bologna, the commanding officer who was caught on tape pepper-spraying nonviolent female protesters. Police advocates have countered that these acts are isolated incidents and are dealt with internally, but Oliver sees it otherwise.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s very little mechanism for accountability for the police who engage in that kind of violent conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d he told The Indypendent, noting that the commander\xe2\x80\x99s punishment included docked vacation days and a transfer to Staten Island, where he resides. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a reward, at the end of the day. At least with respect to the supervisors, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has the backs of the other bosses who stick their necks out this way very consistently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOliver continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Police Department is going back to a lot of the RNC-style kettling and crowd control tactics and using force in individual arrests and cases and using more pepper spray. ...I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been an escalation in response to Occupy Wall Street.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOWS protesters are fighting back in the courts. More than 350 of the 700 people arrested for marching on the Brooklyn Bridge Oct. 1 are taking their cases to trial, arguing that police led them onto the bridge before carrying out a mass arrest.\nWhile two city councilmembers have been violently arrested in the past several months \xe2\x80\x94 one of them during the eviction of OWS in Zuccotti Park in November \xe2\x80\x94 that body\xe2\x80\x99s police oversight committee has never vigorously investigated aggressive tactics against protesters. (The committee is chaired by Peter Vallone, Jr., an outspoken NYPD advocate.)\nFurther, there is no real way to deal with NYPD overreach, despite the department\xe2\x80\x99s own Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) and the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like they\xe2\x80\x99re apolitical,\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver said of the IAB. \xe2\x80\x9cThe CCRB has no teeth in a sense because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority to punish officers. It can only make recommendations, so everybody knows at the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to end up in-house. That\xe2\x80\x99s not really an effective accountability mechanism. Officers can eat a couple of CCRB decisions. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the end of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe result is a dangerous one for democracy. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the reasons why the Police Department acts the way that it does is to chill people, to scare them from being on the streets by making it unpredictable on how you can stay safe,\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver said.\nHe added that the city\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to confront excessive force and unjust arrests means the taxpayers have to pay the litigation costs and the settlements between the city and the victims in class-action lawsuits.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be paying for the police department\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in 2004 for the RNC protest litigation for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is only repeating and in some ways escalating the same problems.\xe2\x80\x9d\nConspiring to use the First Amendment\n\tNew York is not the only city where the power of the legal system is being more zealously deployed against the Occupy movement.\nIn San Diego, police arrested four Occupy protesters Jan. 11 for heckling Mayor Jerry Sanders during his annual State of the City address and slapped each of them with a felony conspiracy charge. The felony charge increased the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 bail from $500 to $10,000. They each face up to two years in jail if convicted. A police spokesperson told voicesofsandiego.org, that conspiracy charges had been applied because the four protesters had chanted from identical scripts.\n\t\xe2\x80\x94John Tarleton\nNational Lawyers Guild: A Short History \n\tFounded in 1937 \xe2\x80\x9cto emphasize humanrights over property rights,\xe2\x80\x9d the National Lawyers Guild has provided legal support to just about every left-leaning protest movement over the past 75 years \xe2\x80\x94 from striking autoworkers in the 1930s to 1960s-era civil rights and antiwar activists to today\xe2\x80\x99s Occupiers.

Around 150 of the movement\xe2\x80\x99s most restless radicals sat on the hardwood floor and in folding chairs at 16 Beaver Street, a block from the Charging Bull in downtown Manhattan. The purpose was a big-picture strategic discussion about where the movement\xe2\x80\x99s tactics had taken it so far and where to go in the coming months. As if to match the scale of the conversation, huge sheets of paper were spread across the center of the room, which scribes markered up with the gist of what was being said.\nThere was no lack of confidence to go around \xe2\x80\x94 just the kind of infectious naiv\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 that drove some of these same people to take and hold Zuccotti Park back in September. They reviewed their favorite things about what they\xe2\x80\x99d done since then: moments that captured the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention and, especially, the ones in which they shed their own fear and had enough fun to want to continue. For better or worse, a lot of this is still fixated on defying the NYPD, rather than really challenging the economic order or movement building A lot of them spoke highly of the barricade-removing hijinks of New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, which was fun if you were there but didn\xe2\x80\x99t play very well in Peoria.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re somewhere between a movement and a revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Austin Guest, a 31-year-old with sideburns on only one side of his thick, brown beard. He added that, if they wanted to, they could bring down Bank of America in six months. Whenever there was a break, someone would jump up on a chair and start telling radical jokes. Why do anarchists only drink coffee? How many feminists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Somebody else would already know the punch line and shout it out, while others burst into laughter until they could hardly breathe. This was not the mood one would expect to find in a bygone movement.\nNor would one expect the litany of upcoming actions reeled off by a woman named Tammy, who, as part of the Interoccupy project, was helping to coordinate occupations nationwide. There would be \xe2\x80\x9cOccupy the Dream\xe2\x80\x9d protests on MLK Day. On Jan. 20, Move to Amend would be organizing actions throughout the country against corporate personhood. There was Occupy Education on March 1, a global day of action on May 12 and actions against the G8 and NATO summits in Chicago later that month. Other people added more: an Egypt solidarity march on Jan. 21, a day recognizing violence against women on Feb. 14 and a mobilization in D.C. marking the anniversary of Dr. King\xe2\x80\x99s assassination on April 4.\nIn the minds of many, the crown jewel was the global general strike that Occupy Los Angeles called for May Day\xe2\x80\x94 though pulling anything close to that, given the state of organized labor in the United States, would seem next to impossible. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m totally in love with the general strike,\xe2\x80\x9d said one middle-aged man, describing himself as an artist who for years has lived below the poverty line. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me it\xe2\x80\x99s analogous to seeing the face of God.\xe2\x80\x9d He also suggested bringing 10,000 people to Battery Park to watch the sun set on the summer solstice, led by Native American shamans.\nAfter the open brainstorming, the facilitator, a tall man with a blond rattail, tried to guide the meeting toward specific \xe2\x80\x9cthroughline projects.\xe2\x80\x9d These, he explained, are big ones that the whole group can put its energy behind, that would string the isolated days of action into an overarching story, disrupt the pillars of support for corporate power and liberate more space that a new kind of world could fill. Breakout groups discussed what these projects might be.\nOne group centered its discussion around mounting occupations of foreclosed homes and defunded schools. The group that attracted the most people was devoted to shutdowns: banks, ports, malls, you name it. A New Jerseyan named Chris, who started the famous We Are the 99 Percent blog, called for balancing these disruptive actions with making the movement \xe2\x80\x9ca healing force.\xe2\x80\x9d Lots of fingers wiggling high in the air \xe2\x80\x94 this went without saying. People had already been talking about setting up childcare enters, schools, kitchens, free clinics and worker-owned co-ops, especially in the public spaces they\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to re-occupy in the spring.\nFrom start to finish, there was almost no talk of the presidential elections \xe2\x80\x94 what virtually everyone else in this country thinks of when they think of politics for the year ahead. The closest those at the meeting came was one quick mention of protests at both parties\xe2\x80\x99 conventions and a call for voter noncooperation.\nBy omission, it seems, this movement intends to create a countervailing narrative to the election-year joust among the powers that be, to get people thinking about a whole different kind of politics. It\xe2\x80\x99s no small task to compete with an election that will spend more money spent in it than ever before imaginable; the movement will need to offer people something more hopeful, more compelling and more tangible than any presidential candidate can promise to deliver.\nIn order to do so, some believe that the movement needs a national coming-together, an Occupied convention to hammer out points of unity. A group working to develop what it calls the \xe2\x80\x9c99% Declaration\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 controversial for its embrace of legislative demands and representative politics \xe2\x80\x94 has called for a \xe2\x80\x9cNational General Assembly\xe2\x80\x9d in Philadelphia on July 4, with delegates elected through its website. The General Assembly at Occupy Philadelphia has countered by passing its own \xe2\x80\x9cNational Gathering Process Proposal,\xe2\x80\x9d which insists that it would only host such a convention if it were planned and peopled by the other Occupy GAs.\nOne of that proposal\xe2\x80\x99s drafters, Nathan Kleinman, explained to me at the Jan. 8 meeting, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not about the gathering itself, this is about how to organize one.\xe2\x80\x9d As always in the movement, process takes precedence. Kleinman is also one of the creators of Interoccupy, where conference calls are now being used on a daily basis by Occupy activists around the country to work together on a variety of projects.\nAnother national convergence is also in the works, with the same organizers as the occupation at Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. (Though it has now joined the Occupy fold, Freedom Plaza was actually being planned months before Occupy Wall Street was first called for in July.) Dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cNOW DC\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the National Occupation of Washington, D.C. \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to begin on Mar. 30 and run for as long as one month. Several of those behind it met in New York on Jan. 7 (at the office of this newspaper) to start setting NOW DC in motion. They also came to 16 Beaver the next day. While Occupy Wall Street was still deciding what to do for the next few months, this group was well into discussing how to do it.\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cThe Occupy movement isn\xe2\x80\x99t really into planning the way we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin Zeese, a onetime Ralph Nader campaign manager, during the NOW DC discussions. And he\xe2\x80\x99s right. Even while meeting to plan and strategize, those at 16 Beaver weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to do away with the improvisational, reactive free-for-all that had brought Occupy Wall Street to the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention in the first place. An organizer with a red, white and blue bandana over his long, curly hair pointed out that their most carefully planned marches had tended to stay on the sidewalks, where police wanted them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe took the road only when we didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just remember that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNathan Schneider is an editor at WagingNonviolence.org, where an earlier version of this article was published.\n'",b'\n',"b'May 2, 2012'","b'For New York City residents, fracking may seem like a distant problem \xe2\x80\x94 a hazard facing those living in regions where there are more trees than people. But fracking is a risk to anyone who drinks water, eats food and breathes air \xe2\x80\x94 that is, all 8 million who reside in our city\xe2\x80\x99s five boroughs.\nFracking is a highly dangerous method of drilling for natural gas that involves blasting a toxic soup of chemicals, sand and water underground to release gas that is trapped in shale rock formations. The toxic chemicals that remain underground, and those brought back to the surface in the wastewater, along with hazardous air emissions, are a threat to public health and the environment. Further, the release of methane, which occurs during this process, accelerates climate change.\nBut while there is growing awareness of fracking\xe2\x80\x99s threats to our water, its potentially disastrous impacts on food and agriculture are less recognized. If Governor Andrew Cuomo allows fracking in New York, it could greatly damage our state\xe2\x80\x99s vibrant agricultural sector, while risking the safety of our food.\nNew York is an agricultural state \xe2\x80\x94 as difficult as that is to believe for concrete jungle inhabitants \xe2\x80\x94 where one-quarter of land area is used for farming. The production of apples, dairy products, wine and other fruits and vegetables provide jobs to thousands of New Yorkers. \nOf course, food is a crucial part of our city\xe2\x80\x99s identity, with famous chefs, bagels, pizza and cuisines from every corner of the planet. A growing movement of Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs), community gardens and Slow Food activists is fueling both the demand and availability of locally produced, healthy food.\nFracking puts all of this at risk, a point that producers, sellers and advocates of healthy food have recognized. Chefs for the Marcellus, the Northeast Organic Farming Association: New York, Slow Food NYC, the Brooklyn Food Coalition, the Park Slope Food Co-op and Food & Water Watch are among those calling on Gov. Cuomo and the state legislature to ban fracking in New York to help protect the state\xe2\x80\x99s farms and food.\nAs Dr. Sandra Steingraber, an environmental studies professor at Ithaca College, explains, \xe2\x80\x9cUpstate New York is a national hot spot for organic agriculture. Cows, wheat fields, vineyards, maple syrup and apple orchards, all of this is part of our public health system. They\xe2\x80\x99re part of a healthy chain. And each of these crops requires clean water. They\xe2\x80\x99re all affected badly by exposure to air pollution.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSteingraber is the chair of New Yorkers Against Fracking, a coalition that is working to ban fracking in New York. A core element of the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is to engage diverse constituencies in the fight against fracking, and to bring that influence to bear on Gov. Cuomo and the state legislature. To that end, the coalition is reaching out \xe2\x80\x94 from Long Island to Buffalo and everywhere in between \xe2\x80\x94 to farmers and other food producers, faith leaders, business owners, health professionals and others who would be impacted by fracking\xe2\x80\x99s threats to our health, economy and communities.\nEric Weltman is senior organizer for Food & Water Watch in New York.

After more than six months, the occupation of the northern section of the Upper Green in New Haven, Conn., was the longest-running outpost of the Occupy Wall Street movement in New England.\nWhile the city initially tolerated the occupation \xe2\x80\x94 with Mayor John DeStefano inviting Occupiers to camp out starting Oct. 15 \xe2\x80\x94 city officials asked Occupiers to depart by \xe2\x80\x9cmid-March\xe2\x80\x9d in a written notice issued March 11.\nMembers of Occupy New Haven (ONH) took their struggle to continue the encampment to the courts. Their first two attempts resulted in last-minute rulings in favor of ONH; the decisions cited questions related to free speech and to who actually had the authority to evict the Occupiers, since the Green is privately owned but managed by the city. However, a day before the removal, a federal judge denied another stay for ONH, ruling that, while the encampment was a form of free speech, the Occupiers were violating city regulations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe past month has been an edgy time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ray Neal, who has been involved with the comfort crew and speaking to the media on behalf of ONH during the occupation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re faced with eviction over and over again from your home, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit wearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe morning of the eviction, 10 Occupiers engaged in civil disobedience, locking arms around a tent decorated with a banner that read: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t evict an idea.\xe2\x80\x9d Police removed them one by one, arresting a total of 13 people. The Occupiers arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and interfering with police.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe city wanted the Occupy New Haven protesters to leave and we came down and made that happen,\xe2\x80\x9d New Haven police sergeant Chris Rubino said that day. He described the relationship between ONH and the police as positive \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cBut everything has to come to an end, and it was time for this to end.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the weeks leading up to the eviction, members of ONH met with city officials to discuss an alternate plan that still required the Occupiers to leave the Green and remove all structures. Members of ONH responded with a list of conditions for vacating the Green, including limiting the salaries of the mayor and police chief to $35,950, the average income for a New Haven family.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only response we got to any of our demands was an eviction letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Aubin, who had been sleeping out on the Green since the beginning of the occupation and served as ONH\xe2\x80\x99s de facto leader. \xe2\x80\x9cOur opinion is that we\xe2\x80\x99re coming in on Yale\xe2\x80\x99s territory... The Yale graduation is coming up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTom Conroy, deputy director of the Office of Public Affairs at Yale, said in an e-mail that Yale had no position on ONH or the city\xe2\x80\x99s eviction.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYale never brought the matter of Occupy New Haven to the city, either in support or in opposition,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.\nParticipants and supporters organized a variety of protests during the encampment, including demonstrations against Bank of America, the American Legislative Exchange Council and a Morgan Stanley recruiting event at Yale, but ONH\xe2\x80\x99s main focus was on creating a community governed by direct democracy. Occupiers also frequently participated in local actions against police brutality and reached out to the city\xe2\x80\x99s homeless population.\nGeneral Assemblies are still held on the Green three times a week.\nJosh Smith, who was involved with ONH\xe2\x80\x99s media working group, thinks that the loss of the encampment won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the efforts of ONH.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that we no longer have a physical encampment merely changes the dynamic of the protest. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need the camp to press on in our quest for social and economic justice. We\xe2\x80\x99ve educated a lot of people and made our point as to what we want. Now, all we have to do is go and push for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith said.\n\xc2\xa0\n17 Occupy Encampments Still Standing\n\tWhen Adbusters put out the call for 20,000 people to set up camp in lower Manhattan on Sept. 17, few people imagined the people who began living in Zuccotti Park would spark similar occupations in more than 650 cities and towns across the United States. Since then, local governments around the country have moved aggressively to dislodge these protest encampments. Seven months later only 17 occupations remain standing. They are located in:\nAnchorage, Alaska\n\tAsheville, N.C.\n\tAtlanta, Ga.\n\tWilmington, Del.\n\tDover, Del.\n\tFairbanks, Alaska\n\tFlint, Mich.\n\tGainesville, Fla.\n\tHuntington Beach, Calif.\n\tLittle Rock, Ark.\n\tMadison, Wis.*\n\tMilwaukee, Wis.\n\tSacramento, Calif.\n\tSan Luis Obispo, Calif.\n\tTalahassee, Fla.\n\tTampa, Fla.\n\tVacaville, Calif.\n\t* '",b'\n',b'05/04/2012 - 4:46pm',b'ONH is still going strong. About 40 of us had a great May Day marching with our Brothers and Sisters in New York.\n',"b'May 2, 2012'","b'Lately, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting the feeling that Occupy Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s past successes are starting to go to the heads of some of the people in the movement. We saw the glory days of Liberty Plaza, and also the recent spurt of momentum surrounding the brief March 17 reoccupation of Zuccotti Park in celebration of OWS\xe2\x80\x99s six-month anniversary. But as police departments across the country make it quite clear that occupations of any kind will not be tolerated, the mood has turned sour. The good old days, it seems, are not coming back. Instead, OWS has turned to a series of legal, temporary, roving \xe2\x80\x9csleepful protests\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 along Union Square, then outside bank branches and now at Wall Street itself.\nMore than a few organizers seem to be operating under the assumption that occupation \xe2\x80\x94 something comparable to last fall but somehow surely better \xe2\x80\x94 is a prerequisite for further political action. Consequently, some of the most talented organizers in New York (as well as, evidently, in Oakland and San Francisco) have been directing a considerable amount of energy into failed reoccupation attempts. When it\xe2\x80\x99s not reoccupying, the movement is celebrating the anniversaries of past successes instead of creating new ones. The more conversations I have with listless, frustrated organizers, though, the more I start to feel that right now this occupation-first logic is entirely backward.\nThis is a new time; the movement and its supporters are in a totally different place than they were last fall. Potential allies expect more from the movement \xe2\x80\x94 as they should. Many who were wholeheartedly behind it a few months ago seem to think it\xe2\x80\x99s over, or should be. The encampments lost much public support as the pressures of police harassment, a lack of resources to assist homeless Occupiers and other factors turned many into unsafe spaces. Videos of Occupiers behaving badly became fodder for a right-wing smear campaign that is now gearing up for any possible resurgence. This matters; in some sense, an occupation is only as good as its public support. That legitimacy is what makes it difficult for the state to mount an eviction without losing face.\nThink of the early morning confrontation so many remember as the climax of Occupy Wall Street. On Oct. 14, thousands of people turned out before dawn to keep Mayor Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s cleaning crews out of the park. The moment those crews were routed, when the announcement came through the people\xe2\x80\x99s mic and the assembled crowd of Occupiers, union workers and supporters burst into cheers \xe2\x80\x94 that was amazing. But it took a lot of committed allies to make that happen. Right now, that support simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be there. Evictions continue without much outcry.\nSo how can the movement recapture that support? How can it, even more than before, light up people\xe2\x80\x99s imaginations and make them want Occupy to stick around? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a modest proposal to a movement that tends not to take or need advice:\nChallenge the power that affects the most people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\nRight now, there are plenty of well-thought-out projects starting up in the movement that address the core issues that moved thousands of people to begin occupying Wall Street in the first place. There\xe2\x80\x99s Fight BAC, a project with the not-so-modest goal of taking down Bank of America. There are efforts to fight foreclosures and evictions through occupations, auction blockades or eviction defense. Disrupt Dirty Power is aimed at finally halting the corporate machine driving climate change. How about a massive student debt strike \xe2\x80\x94 anyone?\nProjects with this level of focus tend to attract relatively small numbers of people compared to re-occupation attempts and rowdy marches. What if they became, for a while, the main business of the movement and the main outlet of its huge creativity? What if the first thing people thought of when they heard the word \xe2\x80\x9cOccupy\xe2\x80\x9d was, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, those kids who saved my friend\xe2\x80\x99s home from foreclosure? I heard they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to take down the most dangerous bank in America!\xe2\x80\x9d Actions that directly challenge the economic violence of the system pose a dilemma for the entire society. You\xe2\x80\x99re asking everyone to choose sides \xe2\x80\x94 not about tents in a park, but about major features of everyday economic life. Do I want Bank of America to foreclose on my neighbor or not? Do I want my kids to spend their post-college lives enslaved by debt or not? These are serious political questions that have the potential to eclipse the nonsense the presidential candidates keep spouting. Suddenly the question of whether to allow the movement to occupy one space or another seems comparatively small.\nAs the movement shifts gears, it\xe2\x80\x99s hugely important to keep the spirit of occupation alive \xe2\x80\x94 though not necessarily in tents.\nOccupiers are mapping the city\xe2\x80\x99s sites of injustice by sleeping out in the Financial District, but just as important is the sense of community at afternoon Town Square events and mutual aid on May Day. This sort of action is constructive rather than just disruptive, and it points the way toward a new, revolutionary society. Lots of people in the movement talk about wanting to see these occupations evolve into sustainable worker cooperatives and serious, large-scale mutual aid networks. But what if that happened in the context of making the most egregious, fundamental crises unmistakably clear \xe2\x80\x94 in the banks, in the schools, in politics, in how we treat our planet?\nCompared to these massive tears in the fabric of society, I suspect that encampments in parks will seem like no big deal. Maybe the movement could even win back the right to occupy with much less effort. At the very least, there will be a whole lot more people standing up against the forces of repression and for the right to occupy. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, we\xe2\x80\x99re changing the world with this movement,\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99ll say. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not let us have a park or a building and do some good with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n'",b'\n',"b'June 13, 2012'","b'I was standing outside the Stonewall Inn last June 24 at the moment gay marriage came to New York State. I had come to the Stonewall not to await the verdict, but as one of more than 200 fabulous queers who had gathered at Tompkins Square Park in the East Village and paraded gaily together across town in the 18th annual drag march commemorating the 1969 Stonewall Riots that marked the birth of the lesbian and gay rights movement.\nWe reached the Stonewall just after 9 p.m. and had a party in the streets. At one point the police roughly tried to push everyone onto the sidewalk, and for a tense few minutes I thought of [the Stonewall Riots on that very spot in June] 1969 as the crowd moved en masse \xe2\x80\x94 one voice, one purpose \xe2\x80\x94 to take back the street, our chants drowning out the dance music down the block (\xe2\x80\x9cThe people! United! Will never be defeated!\xe2\x80\x9d). Though I often satirize movement sloganeering (\xe2\x80\x9cThe slogans! So tired! Will always be repeated!\xe2\x80\x9d), the moment was powerful as the police receded and we reclaimed public space for queer public use.\nI looked sentimentally over the crowd, amazed at the interconnected constellations of my community. I like to call them constellations \xe2\x80\x94 lots of glittering amid that crowd.\nThe gathering felt homey, like the small-town fairs of my childhood. I saw a gay male couple \xe2\x80\x94 one in a magenta bridesmaid\xe2\x80\x99s dress and luxurious peroxide blonde wig, the other in a black corset and heels \xe2\x80\x94 who had welcomed me to their Thanksgiving table at the last minute, the token dyke at a table of radical fairies; two partnered elders who had been close with Sylvia Rivera; a genderqueer friend in a \xe2\x80\x9940s-looking black negligee; her ex moving in her own circles, both welcome in the crowd; my smirky babydyke next-door neighbor; our impish redheaded friend from down the block (who had just domestic partnered her roommate, though they weren\xe2\x80\x99t romantically involved); numerous polyamorous permutations; the populace of various Brooklyn queer shared houses; and even my friend Ruby\xe2\x80\x99s ex, who is also the ex of one of my exes (which reads like an old lesbian joke).\nWhen I fled to the city from upstate 17 years ago, I dreamed of being ensconced in queer community; looking over the crowd, I knew I\xe2\x80\x99d brought at least part of that dream to life. And as I watched that loud, lovely community, dancing in the space we had made for ourselves, marriage was the farthest thing from my mind.\nIt would be convenient to say we were dancing to Sister Sledge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWe Are Family\xe2\x80\x9d when the rumor of statewide gay marriage spread through the crowd. People looked down at their devices to confirm the news; then a wave of cheering came down Christopher Street, and we knew it was true.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, you know they\xe2\x80\x99re going to say this was a party for gay marriage instead of an anniversary of a protest,\xe2\x80\x9d a friend joked. A few hours later the Associated Press claimed, \xe2\x80\x9cA huge street party erupted outside the Stonewall Inn Friday night, with celebrants waving rainbow flags and dancing after the historic vote.\xe2\x80\x9d The gathering may have ended as a marriage celebration, but it hardly began that way \xe2\x80\x94 neither that night at the Stonewall nor in 1969. Gay marriage is not the Stonewall Riots\xe2\x80\x99 happy ending. The story of queer liberation is far from over.\nAnd in the New York Times, the drag march had become little more than a footnote: \xe2\x80\x9cA drag parade on Friday from Tompkins Square Park in the East Village to Stonewall in the West Village also went on as planned \xe2\x80\x94 the ranks of the marchers augmented by people who gathered to be part of history.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWere we at the drag march to commemorate the bulldykes and drag queens fighting back at the original Stonewall Riots, replete with its own tradition, custom and ceremony \xe2\x80\x94 somehow no longer \xe2\x80\x9cpart of history\xe2\x80\x9d now that gay marriage had been achieved? Or were we just being written out of history \xe2\x80\x94 fast?\nGay marriage is a happy victory for many LGBTQ New Yorkers. But I am concerned that, as my comrade Sloan Lesbowitz wrote on her blog True Queer Love, \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage might narrow the group of people we care for into a \xe2\x80\x98family\xe2\x80\x99 at the expense of the expansive group of cared-for people we currently call our community.\xe2\x80\x9d As we approach the one-year anniversary of gay marriage in New York State \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the 43rd anniversary of the Stonewall Riots \xe2\x80\x94 let us remember to think collectively, to recognize ourselves as part of a larger whole. To multiply life not by \xe2\x80\x9cthe power of two,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Indigo Girls would sing, but by the power of millions.\nGay marriage is a great step forward for many families; but let us never forget that we are family.\n\xc2\xa0\nAn earlier version of this article was published on bilerico.com.\n'",b'\n',"b'June 13, 2012'","b'A few months after last year\xe2\x80\x99s Wisconsin uprising at the state capitol, I stood in front of a packed Quaker meeting house overflowing with labor leaders, religious leaders and radical activists. They carried a wide range of feelings: a mood of failure because Gov. Scott Walker had moved through his nefarious legislation, an excitement left over from daily waves of actions and protests and a shared sense of shock and being overwhelmed. They had just inspired some of the largest impromptu civil disobedience in recent U.S. history, even prompting Democratic politicians to follow suit and flee the state in hopes of preventing passage of the bill. They were also vaguely united around a new possibility, one that I feared then would redirect the energy of the movement: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we recall Walker, we can win.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe now see the result. Conservatives are crowing over their guy winning by seven points. They believe Wisconsin is back in play as a swing state for the presidential campaign. Mitt Romney was quick to celebrate, saying this will \xe2\x80\x9cecho beyond the borders.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDemocrats worry it is a portent of things to come for states like my own, Pennsylvania, where our Republican governor is slightly more timid but shares the same goal: to slash and burn the social service safety net. That Walker won by a greater percentage then when he was first put in office certainly gives chilling credibility to Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch\xe2\x80\x99s statement at her victory party: \xe2\x80\x9cNow this is what democracy looks like!\xe2\x80\x9d\nDemocrats and unions are nursing their wounds, rightly complaining about money in politics. In the costly election \xe2\x80\x94 $66 million in total, with Walker outspending Tom Barrett almost 10 to 1 \xe2\x80\x94 a huge amount came from outside sources. Two-thirds of Walker\xe2\x80\x99s money came from out-of-state corporate interests, while just over one-quarter of Barrett\xe2\x80\x99s was from outside the Badger State. But Walker also received almost three times as much in the cash donations from inside the state; he would have had a huge edge even with only in-state money.\nBut I want to back up and return to that Quaker meeting house.\nThe people in the room weren\xe2\x80\x99t the Democratic operatives that flooded the state \xe2\x80\x94 and who, along with Republican operatives, earned a whopping $30.4 million, according to Huffington Post researchers). They were organizers, activists and union leaders.\nThey rightly saw that Walker\xe2\x80\x99s policies could mean the death knell for many union efforts and the rollback of a host of essential services. At length, my co-trainer (and WNV columnist) George Lakey and I invited people to begin designing longer direct-action campaigns. But many in the room swung toward getting behind a unifying effort of recalling Walker. People were mostly for it right away, wooed by the straightforward logic: Take out the guy that screwed you. Makes sense, right?\nNot exactly.\nThe problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t an individual, it\xe2\x80\x99s a crisis of values and priorities. Walker won because folks saw a shrinking economic pie, and they believed he was going to do the tough but necessary belt-tightening required for the state to live within its budget. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dirty secret that many union members \xe2\x80\x94 37 percent \xe2\x80\x94 voted for Walker in the last election. His message made sense to people \xe2\x80\x94 or rather, the people made sense of his message.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the bigger problem. The U.S. economy isn\xe2\x80\x99t supporting people anymore, and we\xe2\x80\x99re running up against differing narratives about what is to blame.\nAt the Quaker meeting house that day, I shared one way to frame what was happening that I had heard earlier from a union member. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not broke,\xe2\x80\x9d I told the crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cour money has been stolen.\xe2\x80\x9d I listed examples of giveaways to corporations. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, an election strategy won\xe2\x80\x99t run on our values, it\xe2\x80\x99ll cater to moderates.\xe2\x80\x9d\nElections focus our efforts and resources on very minor wins: wooing the undecided voter, scaring off the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s supporters and turning out your base. For the most part, Barrett did that. He had a slight edge on undecided voters, and he maintained 94 percent support from those who had voted last year. Where he lost was turning out numbers \xe2\x80\x94 Walker simply got more of his base to vote, as in 2010.\nThe results are somewhat depressing. In every poll, it was evident that many of the same people who voted for Walker voted for him again. He even maintained 37 percent among union members.\nHearts and minds had not been changed. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the saddest part to me, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what really needs to move.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the alternative?\nHere in Pennsylvania, we were able to stop a big $560 million casino development project that had outspent us 200 to 1 \xe2\x80\x94 not including money they donated to city and state politicians, judges and media. We moved the population from being 80 percent supportive to mostly against because we ran campaigns based on values, instead of short-term political efficacy.\nTo wit, our first campaign was called \xe2\x80\x9cOperation Transparency.\xe2\x80\x9d We asked for all of the casino planning documents \xe2\x80\x94 things like site plans, social impact studies and traffic plans \xe2\x80\x94 to be released by Dec. 1 at high noon. If not, we vowed to release them ourselves through a nonviolent search and seizure operation.\nOur campaign built tension and drama, and it culminated in our widely-covered civil disobedience as we tried to obtain the previously hidden planning documents. Without us having to say it, it raised the question: If casinos are so great, why are they being so secretive? Show, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to change people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and minds. It was the strategy of the civil rights movement in the South \xe2\x80\x94 exposing the violence and hypocrisy so it can be seen more clearly.\nTo do that, we have to say no to some of the short-term strategies \xe2\x80\x94 like a lot of electoral campaigns. Unfortunately in Wisconsin, nearly all of the energy got sucked into the recall movement, whose framing was led by Democratic operatives. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any Wisconsin direct action campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 and by saying \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m excluding one-time actions or routine vigils and marches \xe2\x80\x94 that tried to reframe the debate. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a major problem.\nAs our Pennsylvania governor acts like a fool, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be tempting to pour resources into the next electoral campaign against him. But if we keep doing that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to cycle ourselves year-in and year-out into the small wins of the electoral world. We might win elections, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep losing hearts and minds. Instead, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look onto a big horizon and take to long-term, direct-action campaigning.\n\xc2\xa0\nA longer version of this article appeared on wagingnonviolence.org.\n'",b'\n',"b'June 13, 2012'","b'As any New Yorker can tell you, a defining feature of the NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s stop-and-frisk program is its focus on young men of color. Acclaimed civil rights lawyer and scholar Michelle Alexander zeroed in on this disparity when she spoke at Harlem\xe2\x80\x99s Abyssinian Baptist Church in January. She argued that stop-and-frisk, along with the equally discriminatory focus of the so-called War on Drugs, has contributed to the creation of a vast new disenfranchised racial underclass in an astonishingly short period of time: a \xe2\x80\x9cNew Jim Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlexander didn\xe2\x80\x99t always make this comparison. More than a decade ago she was on her way to her new job as director of the Racial Justice Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California when she saw a flyer proclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Drug War is the New Jim Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d She dismissed it as hyperbole. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, the criminal justice system is racist in a lot of ways,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help to make such absurd comparisons to Jim Crow. People will just think you\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d Since then, she has come to agree with the activists who posted the flyer.\nIn order for Alexander to truly understand the impact of mass incarceration, she said she had to overcome the illusion that we live a post-racial society, especially in the age of Obama. \xe2\x80\x9cMany of us, myself included, have slept through a revolution, actually a counter-revolution that has blown back much of the progress that Dr. King and so many other freedom fighters gave their lives for,\xe2\x80\x9d she told her audience in one of Harlem\xe2\x80\x99s preeminent black churches. \xe2\x80\x9cThis counter-revolution occurred with barely a whimper of protest, and yet it has successfully relegated millions of poor people, overwhelmingly people of color, to a permanent second-class status.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was impossible to hear Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s talk without connecting the dots: If you oppose the old racial caste system, then you should oppose the one that is alive and well today in the form of programs such as stop-and-frisk, which feeds a redesigned system of social control.\nBlack and Latino males ages 14 to 24 make up less than 5 percent of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s population, but according to the NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s own records they accounted for almost 42 percent of those stopped and interrogated in 2011. Most of the people stopped are innocent, and those arrested and charged are often found guilty of minor drug offenses. Few have any history of violence or selling drugs. Now they are marked as criminals.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe criminal label is essential, for forms of explicit racial exclusion are not only prohibited but widely condemned,\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander explains in The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in an Age of Colorblindness. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you\xe2\x80\x99re labeled a felon, the old forms of discrimination \xe2\x80\x94 employment discrimination, housing discrimination, denial of the right to vote, denial of educational opportunity, denial of food stamps and other public benefits, and exclusion from jury service \xe2\x80\x94 are suddenly legal. As a criminal, you have scarcely more rights, and arguably less respect, than a black man living in Alabama at the height of Jim Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJust as in the past, young black men don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be convicted felons to be suspected of criminal behavior. In a recent interview Alexander analyzed George Zimmerman\xe2\x80\x99s shooting of Trayvon Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, hundreds of thousands of black and brown young men are subjected to the very kinds of interrogations that Zimmerman was trying to carry out, because of stop-and-frisk policies,\xe2\x80\x9d she told In These Times. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we treat these policies as the price that black men must pay for the security of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNow that Alexander has provided the context we needed to make sense of this human rights disaster, the challenge is for New Yorkers to refuse the argument put forth by biased police, prosecutors and judges that stop-and-frisk is a fair way to target crime. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we are successful,\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander writes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe new public consensus will be rooted in compassion, fairness and dignity for all \xe2\x80\x94 a radical departure from the overwhelming punitiveness aimed at the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable populations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xc2\xa0\nRen\xc3\xa9e Feltz was a 2010 Soros Justice Media Fellow.

It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a modern phenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d anti-racism scholar Tim Wise said in a 2009 interview with the Open Society Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite folks, going back 40 to 50 years, did not, even in the early \xe2\x80\x9960s, think that racism was really a big deal worth focusing very much attention on. A small minority did realize that, but the vast majority said at that time that people of color had equal opportunity with white folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cRearview racism\xe2\x80\x9d describes the view that bigotry is visible only as a relic of the past and not as a real, lived and present reality. This view assumes that we live in an equal nation in which radical change is not needed. It amplifies the internalized racism of the oppressed, as seen, for example, in a 2007 Pew Research Center survey in which middle-class Blacks said there was a \xe2\x80\x9cwidening\xe2\x80\x9d gulf of values between themselves and poor Blacks.\nMichelle Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness shatters the \xe2\x80\x9crearview mirror\xe2\x80\x9d by forcing readers to see how, with new words and methods, our nation reproduces racial caste. The book focuses on the criminal justice system \xe2\x80\x94 a central conduit that transforms citizens into domestic aliens. In the name of the war on drugs, she writes, police patrol, stop, frisk and arrest poor people in ghettos. This practice has left 80 percent of Black men in most major cities with criminal records. Once released from incarceration, she explains, they enter a \xe2\x80\x9chidden underworld of legalized discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d where ex-felons can\xe2\x80\x99t vote, can\xe2\x80\x99t get jobs, can\xe2\x80\x99t find housing and can\xe2\x80\x99t escape the stigma of having a record.\nPeople of color of every class experience some degree of discrimination, but the Black poor are the true target of the new Jim Crow. The Black poor, once a part of a cross-class alliance with the Black middle and upper classes, were abandoned after the legal victories of the civil rights movement. Left behind in the coffin of the inner cities, poor Black families have been living the continuous nightmare of Jim Crow since the end of the Reconstruction era.\nThe Old Jim Crow\nWhen the smoke of civil war cleared in 1865, African-Americans staggered onto the roads and searched for those who had been sold into slavery. Names were carried by memory for miles across the war-blasted land in hopes of finding lost kin. Sometimes they were dead. But even when newly emancipated people found their parents or children alive, their joyful embraces were mixed with pain as their hands felt scars on their loved ones\xe2\x80\x99 backs.\nIn her book Sugar of the Crop: My Journey to Find the Children of Slaves, author Sana Butler interviewed the last, dying offspring of slaves. She asked them what happened in the years after the Civil War. An elderly woman named Jenny told her, \xe2\x80\x9cOur parents no longer lived for themselves. Their mindset was \xe2\x80\x94 I no longer have a life. I am living for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s parents didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell her the details of slavery because \xe2\x80\x9cthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t want me to be angry. They wanted me to come up with my own reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSlowly, in the wake of war, life restarted. Five million Black people had left slavery and become citizens. They were dirt poor. They were trapped in the South. In order to provide for them, the Radical Republicans in Congress created the Federal Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau, which oversaw the labor contracts of former slaves, opened schools and distributed food and medicine. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant vowed to protect Black people\xe2\x80\x99s right to vote; two years later, Black politicians were elected to state offices across the South.\nAnd then the terror began. White militias shot Black voters, stuffed ballot boxes and paraded in the streets. They called themselves the Ku Klux Klan, the White League and the Red Shirts \xe2\x80\x94 groups whose names burned fear into the mind. In the wake of the elections of 1876, conservative President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal soldiers from Southern capitals and abandoned Blacks to the rage of their former owners.\nNew laws came down like an iron curtain between Black people and freedom. Poll taxes and literacy tests were followed by the physical separation of public space. Life shrank inside paranoia. If whites were on the sidewalk, you jumped off. When whites talked, you lowered your head and voice until your whole being fit into the shuffling, smiling caricature of Jim Crow: a buffoonish \xe2\x80\x9ccoon\xe2\x80\x9d image that let whites imagine Blacks as nonthreatening servants. If Blacks pushed for rights, whites projected more threatening imagery onto them, such as the rapist Black male \xe2\x80\x9cbrute\xe2\x80\x9d or lascivious \xe2\x80\x9cJezebel,\xe2\x80\x9d and then hung, raped or burned Black people alive.\nSegregation deepened into a chasm. In 1890, Louisiana politicians passed the Separate Car Act dividing trains into white and \xe2\x80\x9ccolored.\xe2\x80\x9d When it was challenged, the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that \xe2\x80\x9cseparate but equal\xe2\x80\x9d was legal. Racists were free to force Black children into separate schools and to grow up in separate neighborhoods and work in separate jobs. Black citizens could be arrested, tried and sentenced in all-white courts. It was a cultural cycle that, like a boa constrictor, choked those trapped inside \xe2\x80\x94 and it continues today.\nChildhood Lessons\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the smart child,\xe2\x80\x9d the tester said to a Black girl. They were in a classroom looking at a cartoon series of identical girls whose skin went from white to brown. The Black girl pointed to the image of the white girl. When asked why, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s white.\xe2\x80\x9d The tester asked, \xe2\x80\x9cShow me the dumb child.\xe2\x80\x9d Hesitating, the Black girl pointed to an image of the Black girl.\nOn April 2, CNN aired an Anderson Cooper 360 series that investigated the effect of racism on children. It recreated the \xe2\x80\x9cDoll Tests,\xe2\x80\x9d made famous by Kenneth Clark in 1940, in which he gave two identical dolls, one brown, the other white, to Black children, then asked which was prettiest. They overwhelmingly chose the white doll.\nRacism pours into the minds of children and warps their self-image. Cooper described it as a \xe2\x80\x9cdeluge\xe2\x80\x9d of messages from the surrounding adult culture. In the test, when asked which skin color looked worst, 70 percent of older Black children and 61 percent of the youngest picked the darkest shade.\nFAMILY LIFE\nOut of 40 million African-Americans, 10 million live in suffocating poverty \xe2\x80\x94 and they are being joined by the new poor. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2008 the poverty rate was around 13 percent \xe2\x80\x94 nearly 40 million people. Three years after the 2008 Wall Street crash, in 2011, the rate had swelled by nearly three million. These Americans once lived in the middle class but lost their jobs, lost their homes and wept in shock as their furniture was thrown on their front lawns.\nPoverty recreates poverty. Looking at Jim Crow America and at the Black poor, we can see the effect of generational scarcity. Families are broken by the stress of hopelessness\xe2\x80\x94 they work too hard for too long, earn too little and become estranged or get caught in a downward spiral of drugs and jail. The Children\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Fund, in a 2011 report entitled Portrait of Inequality: Black Children in America, found that 40 percent of Black children live in poverty, and that half of Black children live only with their mother. Black children are seven times more likely to have at least one parent (usually the father) in prison.\nFailing Schools\nThe stress of poverty follows children into the schools. Portrait of Inequality notes that \xe2\x80\x9cat nine months Black babies score lower on measures of cognitive development than white babies.\xe2\x80\x9d At 24 months, the gap triples. By age four, Black children are on a slippery slope of worsening test scores.\nThe chaotic life of poverty and its toll on relationships often means that parents fight and split up. Family members come back from prison traumatized and unable to find jobs. Sickness kills relatives who don\xe2\x80\x99t have healthcare, riddling the family with holes of despair. The book Black Children: Social, Educational and Parental Environments, edited by Harriet Pipes McAdoo, explores children\xe2\x80\x99s coping mechanisms: when a father loses a job or a mother is sick, children alternate between self-isolation and \xe2\x80\x9cacting out\xe2\x80\x9d to demand love. In school this behavior can lead to punishment or interfere with learning. Portrait of Inequality found that a black child is \xe2\x80\x9cone and a half times more likely than a white child to be placed in a class for students with emotional disturbances\xe2\x80\x9d and twice as likely to be labeled mentally retarded.\nBlack youth are more likely to be suspended and expelled, forcing them to slip further backward. Nearly forty percent of Black children are trapped in \xe2\x80\x9cdrop out factories.\xe2\x80\x9d Our education system works like a filter that lets few Black students into college \xe2\x80\x94Black males ages 18 and up comprise only 5 percent of the U.S. college educated population, but nearly 40 percent of the prison population. And for the few who graduate from college, ready to perform the entry-level skilled work that used to be the ladder to the middle class, there is little work: such jobs account for 95 percent of the jobs destroyed by the 2008 Wall Street crash.\n\xe2\x80\x98THE NEW N-WORD\xe2\x80\x99\nThe prisons are filled with Black high school dropouts. In the academic journal Daedalus, sociologists Bruce Western and Betty Pettit noted that in 1980, roughly 10 percent of Black high school dropouts were in jail. Twenty-eight years later, 37 percent were imprisoned. If the trends hold, 68 percent of Black dropouts born from 1975 to 1979 will end up in jail.\nAnd as Michelle Alexander points out in The New Jim Crow, whites and Blacks do drugs at roughly the same amount, but Blacks are arrested at much higher rates. She writes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe U.S. penal population exploded from around 300,000 to more than 2 million, with drug convictions accounting for the majority.\xe2\x80\x9d Of the 2.1 million men in prison, 42 percent are Black: nearly 900,000 men. Even when released, these men are barred from full participation in society.\nOne Black pastor quoted by Alexander said: \xe2\x80\x9cFelony is the new N-word. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to call you a nigger anymore. They just say you\xe2\x80\x99re a felon. In every ghetto you see alarming numbers of young men with felony convictions. Once you have that felony stamp, your hope for employment, for any kind of integration into society, it begins to fade out. Today\xe2\x80\x99s lynching is a felony charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\nVOTER SUPPRESSION\nFelons can\xe2\x80\x99t vote. And when voter suppression laws pass, neither can the poor. In a repeat of the poll tax, literacy tests and voter intimidation of the old Jim Crow era, today the right to vote is being re-segregated. In Alabama, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Florida and Wisconsin, Republican governors and lawmakers are enacting strict new voting laws. These range from purging voter rolls of \xe2\x80\x9cillegals\xe2\x80\x9d to demanding that voters show photo IDs, which poor people, who move often and don\xe2\x80\x99t have money to get new IDs, often don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\nBen Jealous, the president of the NAACP, recently said on Democracy Now!, \xe2\x80\x9cMore states have passed more laws pushing more citizens in our country out of the ballot box in the past 12 months than in \xe2\x80\x94 you know, than since the rise of Jim Crow. You have to go back to the 1890s to find a year when we passed more laws pushing more voters out of the ballot box than we have seen in the past 12 months, five million people pushed out, disproportionately Black and brown.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCYCLE OF LIFE\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did thirteen years in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d Tony, my neighbor in Bed-Stuy, said as we sat on the stoop. \xe2\x80\x9cEven now it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get work.\xe2\x80\x9d We watched young men light a joint, eyeing the street for cops. Nearby, a young girl with pigtails chased a boy who was laughing so hard he hiccupped. I looked at them and wondered how long it would be before they dropped out of school and began smoking and fighting on the block. How long until their first arrests?\nHere is the cycle of life in Third World New York: Black and Latino kids go to broken public schools from which nearly half don\xe2\x80\x99t graduate, they enter a jobless economy, and they become racially profiled teens who are stopped and frisked and jailed, who return home unable to find work, housing or support, who become absent fathers or beleaguered mothers, who end up exhausted and old, helplessly watching from the stoop as their children go to the same broken schools to begin the cycle all over again.\nAnd the rage twisting inside me is that they are the most vulnerable among us. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have savings to pay lawyers or fines; they don\xe2\x80\x99t have status to protect them or a social movement to trumpet their cause. They are the descendants of American slaves, and their lives have been cannon fodder for our schools and prisons. They and their families have lived through centuries of a racial nightmare that no one, not even our first Black president, wants to name.\nSmall towns in America love to post welcome signs. I wanted to walk to the end of my block and nail into the sidewalk one that reads: \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to Jim Crow America.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'",b'\n',b'07/24/2012 - 4:43pm',"b'The CIA\'s role in the international drug trade, dating back to 1949, is not a theory but a well-documented ""fact."" The sources include former CIA and DEA agents.\n""CIA are drug smugglers."" - Federal Judge Bonner, while head of the DEA\nIn 1989, \'The Kerry Committee\' found that the United States Department of State had made payments to drug traffickers, concluding that members of the U.S. State Department themselves were involved in drug trafficking. Some of the payments were made even after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies, or even while these traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.\nA VERY BRIEF HISTORY:\n* Shortly after World War II, The OSS (the predecessor of the CIA) formed a strategic alliance with the Sicilian and Corsican mafia. \n* During the 1950s, In order to provide covert funds for forces loyal to General Chiang Kai-Shek who were fighting the Chinese communists under Mao Zedong, the CIA helped the Kuomintang (KMT) smuggle opium from China and Burma to Thailand, by providing airplanes owned by one of their front businesses, Air America.\n* During the long years of the cold war, the CIA mounted major covert guerilla operations along the Soviet-Chinese border. In 1950, for their operation against communist China in northeastern Burma, and from 1965 to 1975 [during the Vietnam war], for their operation in northern Laos, the CIA recruited (as allies) people we now call drug lords. \n* Throughout the 1980s, in Afghanistan, the CIA\'s supported the Mujahedin rebels (in their efforts against the pro-Soviet government) by facilitating their opium smuggling operations. - A small local trade in opium was turned into a major source of supply for the world markets including the United States. This lead ultimately to Afghanistan becoming the largest supplier of illicit opium on the planet, a status only briefly interrupted when it was under Taliban control.  \n* Also during the 1980s, the Reagan Administration funded a guerrilla force known as the Nicaraguan Contras (even after such funding was outlawed by Congress) by cocaine smuggling operations. - An August 1996 series in the San Jose Mercury News (by Pulitzer Prize-winner Gary Webb) clearly linked the origins of crack cocaine in California to the CIA and the Contras.\n* In November 1996, a Miami grand jury indicted former Venezuelan anti-narcotics chief and longtime CIA asset, General Ramon Guillen Davila, who was smuggling many tons of cocaine into the United States from a CIA owned Venezuelan warehouse. In his trial defense, Guillen claimed that all of his drug smuggling operations were approved by the CIA.\n* The Direcci\xc3\xb3n Federal de Seguridad was a Mexican intelligence agency created in 1947, and was in part a CIA creation. DFS badges were handed out to top-level Mexican drug-traffickers and were a virtual license to traffic.\' ""The Guadalajara Cartel"" (Mexico\'s most powerful drug-trafficking network in the early 1980s) prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the DFS, under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro, a CIA asset.\nFor far more detailed information kindly google any of the following: \n""The Big White Lie: The CIA and the Cocaine/Crack Epidemic"" by former DEA agent Michael Levine\n""Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion"" by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb\n""Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press"" by Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair\n""The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade"" by Alfred W.

We blast the air-conditioner; rub ice cubes on our necks and fan ourselves in the shade. And after a snowless winter the city\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue with heat is growing. As the mercury shoots up, people are forced to ask the question, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy?\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s our job as progressives not just to answer that question, \xe2\x80\x9cyes of course, the planet is slowly boiling.\xe2\x80\x9d But to ask why, in the face of international scientific consensus, does anyone have to ask that question in the first place?\nThe answer is \xe2\x80\x94 ideology and dissociation. The first creates the latter. Ideology is the worldview that sets one\xe2\x80\x99s goals and actions. Determined by one\xe2\x80\x99s class interest, it becomes a narrative filter that lets some part of reality through but keeps another part out. Example one: a 2012 survey by Forecast the Facts showed that nearly half of TV forecasters don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in climate change. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the picture \xe2\x80\x94 well-dressed, well-paid corporate weather men and women, watching satellite maps on computer screens in air -conditioned offices, tell us that the increasingly weird and dangerous weather is just nature temporarily off its meds and going bipolar.\nWhy the nonsense? The first reason is social networks. TV forecasters work at corporate media outfits funded by corporate ads and after work, they drink and mingle with the corporate elite. The daily work environment is a total atmosphere of capitalist \xe2\x80\x9cget some.\xe2\x80\x9d Second is professional jealousy. TV forecasters don\xe2\x80\x99t have doctorates, just master\xe2\x80\x99s degrees and most often not even in science-related fields. And yet, our teeth-whitened teleprompter readers are divas of science in their small soundstage worlds. In turn, the institutions they work for shape their consciousness to protect the corporate status quo, which determines how they read the weather. And that, friends, is the classic definition of ideology.\nOn the other hand, climate scientists, who often work at universities or nonprofit foundations don\xe2\x80\x99t have the profit-motive to warp their work. Instead, they trudge far from the cameras to the poles of the earth to test ice and measure carbon levels. They compile the facts. They write reports pointing to a warming, out of control atmosphere. But they are awkward in front of the camera. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have the money or connections from the late night corporate mingling. And that means they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the mass audiences of TV forecasters.\nSo here is the social contradiction. The climate scientists who work in public institutions have the least access to the public. While TV forecasters, who work in for-profit, private businesses have the most access to the public. And that is ideology as social reproduction.\nWhat is the consequence of all this? Dissociation \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a psychological term to describe a state of being in which one is detached from physical or emotional reality. Now, when Americans see forests on fire or dying crops, they\xe2\x80\x99re completely disconnected from the true urgency of these events. Instead, they simply fall back on the explanation that corporate ideology offers time and again: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, that\xe2\x80\x99s weird.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEven worse. this dissociation leaves people not just without a reason but also without a way forward. Can we stop the severe weather? What do we do? In the absence of an answer, people will go with individual comfort strategies \xe2\x80\x94 blasting the air-conditioning, or jumping in the pool or sitting in the shade. But as New York gets closer to becoming Soylent Green, individual survival strategies won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough.\nAnd that means we are the \xe2\x80\x9cTipping Point\xe2\x80\x9d generation. We don\xe2\x80\x99t experience climate change as the \xe2\x80\x9cNew Normal\xe2\x80\x9d because we have the experience of the decades before to measure reality against corporate ideology. And it\xe2\x80\x99s telling that after decades of dissociation, American trust in media is at a low, a 2011 Gallup poll showed 55 percent did not trust the news media while in April 2012 a poll by Knowledge Networks showed that 69 percent believe global warming is causing the wild weather.\nOccupy Wall Street was the slap to the face of the plutocracy that has made it possible to talk about economic inequality and be heard proving once again that how we frame problems shapes how we see the solutions. To get the Green Deal and the post-carbon future we need, we have to use every means at our disposal to force a similarly radical and honest conversation about climate change. This is the essential first step.\n'",b'\n',b'07/24/2012 - 5:57pm',"b'""As environmental science has advanced, it has become apparent that the human appetite for animal flesh is a driving force behind virtually every major category of environmental damage now threatening the human future: deforestation, erosion, fresh water scarcity, air and water pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, social injustice, the destabilization of communities, and the spread of disease.""

They work as freelancers or temporary workers, on contract or on call, or their employers define them (often illegally) as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent contractors.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTheir ranks include writers and warehouse workers, janitors and business consultants, truck drivers and graphic designers \xe2\x80\x94 and their numbers are rising. Richard Greenwald, a sociologist and professor at St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s College in Brooklyn, estimates that their share of the U.S. workforce has increased by close to half in the last 10 years. In July, Staffing Industry Analysts, an industry research company, reported that the average share of contingent workers at companies it surveyed had gone up by one-third since 2009, to 16 percent. Last year, a different survey found that contingent workers averaged 22 percent of the workers at 200 large companies.\nThese workers are often called the \xe2\x80\x9cprecariat,\xe2\x80\x9d a combination of \xe2\x80\x9cprecarious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproletariat,\xe2\x80\x9d because the traditional social safety nets for workers don\xe2\x80\x99t support them. They have no job security as they hustle from one gig to the next, and they often don\xe2\x80\x99t know where their next job is coming from or when it will come. They very rarely get paid sick days or vacation. They don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid extra for working overtime. They are usually not eligible for unemployment benefits, and they generally have to pay both the worker\xe2\x80\x99s and the employer\xe2\x80\x99s share of Social Security taxes. They have to pay for their own health insurance, and Obamacare won\xe2\x80\x99t change that. (However, beginning in 2014, people will be able to buy private insurance at group rates, and lower-income and working-class people will get some subsidies to help them pay for it.)\nThey have few options if an employer cheats them out of their pay. If they are independent contractors, they do not have the right to form a labor union.\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstability is going to be with us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sara Horowitz, head of the New York-based Freelancers Union. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a period of decline for workers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe New Way We Work\nWho are freelancers and contingent workers? The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has not done an official study since 2005, when it estimated that they were 10 to 15 percent of the U.S. workforce. If their income is reported on a 1099 tax form instead of on a W-2 form with deductions, its monthly payroll surveys won\xe2\x80\x99t count them as having jobs. Its household surveys count them as employed, but don\xe2\x80\x99t ask about their job arrangements.\nCatherine Ruckelshaus, legal co-director of the National Employment Law Project in New York, counts as a contingent worker \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone who\xe2\x80\x99s not a W-2 employee,\xe2\x80\x9d including people paid on 1099s, franchisees, and people paid in cash, such as construction day laborers. Richard Greenwald arrived at his estimates by counting sole-proprietorship businesses and people who listed more income on 1099s than on W-2s.\nThe number has risen significantly in the last 15 years, Greenwald says, and the pace has increased since the recession began, with many new \xe2\x80\x9cpermatemp\xe2\x80\x9d jobs. This trend affects workers at all income levels, but the fastest-growing sector is college graduates in \xe2\x80\x9ccreative\xe2\x80\x9d fields. In the last few years, book publishers and advertising agencies have outsourced their graphic designers, hiring them back as freelancers with no benefits. Many publishers now hire editors on a per-manuscript basis.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the industry or technology tweaks, it often does so in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s freelance or non-union,\xe2\x80\x9d says Justin Molito, director of organizing with the Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Guild of America East. For example, writers on HBO\xe2\x80\x99s scripted shows are unionized, but those on basic cable and reality TV shows aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\nGreenwald distinguishes between workers who chose freelancing and those who were \xe2\x80\x9cshoved into it.\xe2\x80\x9d The most successful freelancers, he says, are information technology, management and finance consultants. They have a specific skill and steady clients, and \xe2\x80\x9cthink of themselves as entrepreneurs.\xe2\x80\x9d Many white-collar freelancers make middle-class incomes, $45,000 to $50,000 a year, he says, but they have to pay for the office supplies, health insurance and taxes that would normally be covered by an employer, and they have no security.\nThis is not just a recession-induced thing, he says. It reflects a long-term change in the economy. Since the 1980s, management\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy has evolved to \xe2\x80\x9clook at work as projects.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of keeping employees on staff to perform all work needed, they outsource tasks or hire consultants.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gives companies tremendous flexibility without any risk,\xe2\x80\x9d Greenwald says. \xe2\x80\x9cFlexibility\xe2\x80\x9d means they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to keep people on the payroll during slack periods, pay them when they\xe2\x80\x99re sick, pay for their health insurance, or obey workplace regulations. This, he says, has \xe2\x80\x9cshifted all the risks that large institutions used to have onto the backs of individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great business model, but as a social model, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. Essentially, it means that the world of work is becoming more like the music business, in which a handful of superstars get rich and a minority of professionals have steady work with benefits, but most workers have to scuffle for intermittent, low-paying gigs, and hard work and talent are worthless without marketing skills, clout and charisma. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bar to get in is low, but [making] a living is harder and harder,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nThe overall social change \xe2\x80\x9cmight be as big as the shift from farm to factory,\xe2\x80\x9d Greenwald says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that many freelancers have thought of this as a permanent way of life. It seems to be a shift back to 19th-century artisanal culture.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Casual Working Class\nThough the traditional image of a freelancer is a middle-class professional like a magazine writer or computer consultant, this shift affects a huge number of blue-collar workers too, especially in the fast-growing fields of warehousing, delivery and home healthcare. Many of these workers are now either temps or defined as \xe2\x80\x9cindependent contractors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften relying on the use of temporary and staffing agencies, outsourcing in these industries has also resulted in comparatively lower wages for work similar to the jobs previously performed in-house,\xe2\x80\x9d the National Employment Law Project reported in \xe2\x80\x9cChain of Greed,\xe2\x80\x9d a study of Walmart warehouses released in June.\nAt the Nissan auto factory in Canton, Miss., more than 20 percent of the 4,400 workers are temps, according to the Labor Notes monthly newsletter. The company says it plans to hire 1,000 new workers this year, but all will be temporary. The temps start at $12 an hour, $7-11 less than what permanent workers earn after five years, and workers say no temp has ever been permanently hired at the plant. Even at Ford\xe2\x80\x99s Detroit-area plants, the classic bastion of union industrial labor, local activist Dianne Feeley, a retired United Auto Workers member, says a significant percentage of workers are temps or contract workers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA huge problem,\xe2\x80\x9d says Catherine Ruckelshaus, is employers illegally defining workers as independent contractors. \xe2\x80\x9cSome employers are asking workers to form LLCs (limited liability companies, a form of business that combines features of a corporation and a partnership) before a construction drywall job.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFedEx Ground, for example, defines its 15,000 drivers as independent contractors, even though they drive company-assigned routes and must drive vans with the FedEx logo and color scheme.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are millions of Americans classified as independent contractors by the companies they work for, but [they are] effectively working as employees,\xe2\x80\x9d American Rights at Work, a Washington-based labor-rights nonprofit, said in a 2007 report on FedEx Ground. \xe2\x80\x9cThese workers suffer the worst of both worlds: they toil without the protections and benefits of employees, yet are without the control over their work that true independent contractors enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe legal definition, Ruckelshaus says, is whether the person is running an independent business \xe2\x80\x94 are they investing their own money, and can they pass on increased costs? The Internal Revenue Service\xe2\x80\x99s general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person hiring them has \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to control or direct only the result of the work,\xe2\x80\x9d while the worker decides \xe2\x80\x9cthe means and methods of accomplishing the result.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe scam\xe2\x80\x99s advantage for employers is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay minimum wage, overtime, workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation or Social Security, Medicare and unemployment taxes. The result, the American Rights at Work report said, is that FedEx drivers not only make less money than those at UPS, who are permanent workers with a union; they also have to pay for gas and maintenance for their vans. Many lease vans from a company-approved supplier, Ruckelshaus says.\nSome employers even define janitors and home healthcare aides as \xe2\x80\x9cfranchisees\xe2\x80\x9d she continues. For example, an office building\xe2\x80\x99s management might hire a cleaning-services subcontractor, whose workers then \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d the job of cleaning one section of the building, paying in advance in exchange for a piece of the company\xe2\x80\x99s fee.\nCoverall, a Florida-based cleaning-services company, calls its more than 9,000 workers \xe2\x80\x9cfranchisees,\xe2\x80\x9d and its more than 90 regional offices are \xe2\x80\x9csupport centers.\xe2\x80\x9d In Boston, says Ruckelshaus, these franchisees might have to pay the company as much as $10,000 to claim a job, recouping that investment from their wages. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the money, they can borrow it from a company-recommended lender. In some cases, she says, they have had to work the first month on spec, getting paid for it only if the Coverall boss approves them for the job. They also have to buy cleaning equipment and supplies from the company. But Coverall makes the deals for the jobs, so the workers can\xe2\x80\x99t raise their rates or ask the client for work on their own.\nIn home healthcare, a field with 3 million mostly women workers that is one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the U.S. economy, for-profit agencies call themselves \xe2\x80\x9cregistries\xe2\x80\x9d of independent contractors. They do this, says Ruckelshaus, even though they hire the workers, train them, assign them to jobs and set rates. It means they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay minimum wage or overtime.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt becomes part of the structure of these jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWarehouse and shipping work is a major area of abuse as well. Walmart and Amazon outsource their massive warehouse and shipping operations to subcontractors, who then use temporary agencies to hire employees. Workers often don\xe2\x80\x99t even know who their actual employer is, says Ruckelshaus.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey pit these little subcontractors against each other,\xe2\x80\x9d says Erin Johansson, research director of American Rights at Work. \xe2\x80\x9cTo compete and win a contract, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pay your workers minimal wages.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn this system, according to the \xe2\x80\x9cChain of Greed\xe2\x80\x9d report, workers are paid piecework, according to the number of containers or trucks they finish unloading on a shift, instead of an hourly wage. They don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid for anything else they do on the job. The result is \xe2\x80\x9crampant minimum wage and overtime violations,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said. Workers also have to unload dangerously stacked piles of boxes, some of which weigh up to 200 pounds, says Johansson.\nWalmart insists on ever-lower costs, so \xe2\x80\x9cworkers are the ones getting squeezed and chiseled,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ruckelshaus. \xe2\x80\x9cThis relationship is hurting low-wage women and those at the bottom of the supply chains, and the big corporations aren\xe2\x80\x99t being held accountable for low wages and poor conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother issue is that freelancers have almost no recourse if an employer cheats them. State wage-theft laws do not cover freelancers. If a client stiffs them, it\xe2\x80\x99s considered a business dispute, so their only recourse is to sue in small-claims court. That can take months and multiple court appearances, and even if you win your case, collecting the debt is not guaranteed.\nThe Freelancers Union says 77 percent of its 180,000 members have had trouble collecting money they\xe2\x80\x99re owed. Earlier this year, it lobbied for New York to enact a law that would let stiffed freelancers file wage-theft complaints with the state Department of Labor. But in New York\xe2\x80\x99s gerrymandered legislature, the measure wound up as a \xe2\x80\x9cone-house bill\xe2\x80\x9d: It passed in the Democrat-dominated Assembly, but never reached the floor in the Republican-controlled state Senate.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have 30 percent of the workforce being exploited, that lowers standards for everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d says Johansson.\nWhat Can Be Done?\nTraditional union organizing is notoriously difficult with contingent workers. Organized labor\xe2\x80\x99s strongest power over employers is workers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to go on strike and stop production. If freelancers try that on their own, the employer will simply hire someone else. That they have neither a common location nor a collective workforce is also a barrier to organizing collectively.\nThe Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Guild of America, a union of TV and movie screenwriters, has successfully organized freelancers, winning elections and creating collective-bargaining agreements at studios. In July, it won company-paid health benefits, paid vacation, and a minimum salary for writers at two New York reality-show studios. But its 4,000 members\xe2\x80\x99 status is much closer to permanent workers than that of most freelancers. They usually work on long-term contracts, typically three or four years, and have \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional relationships and solidarity among themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Guild\xe2\x80\x99s Justin Molito.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a long-term movement to aid those who\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen through the cracks,\xe2\x80\x9d Molito says. \xe2\x80\x9cAs other industries become more freelance, the labor movement has to develop strategies to create organizations that provide protections and make improvements.\xe2\x80\x9d Those strategies include \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding a long-term movement, raising standards across the board, trying to organize an entire industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Freelancers\xe2\x80\x99 Union has largely abandoned the traditional union model, to the point where the organization might be more accurately described as a service and lobbying group than a labor union. Permanent workers are losing security and benefits, says union head Sara Horowitz, so why should freelancers expect them?\n\xe2\x80\x9cI exist in reality,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first step is to admit that something\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\nInstead, she touts what she calls the \xe2\x80\x9cnew mutualism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 freelancers banding together on the principles of \xe2\x80\x9caffinity and solidarity,\xe2\x80\x9d such as networking and organizing cooperatives to buy food and health insurance. (The group sells nonprofit health insurance to 23,000 members in New York, and plans to expand that to New Jersey and Oregon in 2014, when the Obamacare insurance exchanges open.)\nBut how is any of that going to help get freelancers paid sick days? \xe2\x80\x9cGood luck with that,\xe2\x80\x9d she answers.\nOrganized freelancers \xe2\x80\x9cwill be able to make the freelance economy work even better,\xe2\x80\x9d she explains in an e-mail, \xe2\x80\x9cby influencing the freelance labor market, by continuing to improve the laws that affect freelancers (i.e., passing legislation to give freelancers recourse when they are stiffed) and by continuing to give freelancers opportunities to work together.\xe2\x80\x9d On the other hand, she says the Freelancers Union will not be able on its own to \xe2\x80\x9creverse larger economic trends\xe2\x80\x9d like declining wages in the media industry.\nWorkers should speak out about abuses, says Johansson. The bad publicity created by \xe2\x80\x9cshining a light on working conditions for large companies\xe2\x80\x9d such as Walmart and Amazon might help hold them accountable for how subcontractors and their workers are treated.\nLegally, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cjust enforcing the law\xe2\x80\x9d against misclassification would help. In June, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the 350 taxi drivers at Baltimore-Washington International Airport had been wrongly classified as independent contractors. Their employer, which has an exclusive contract for taxi service at the airport, is appealing the decision.\nSen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) have introduced bills to tighten the definition of an independent contractor.\nStill, trying to improve conditions for freelancers and contingent workers is difficult in an economic system that has been vampirizing workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights and incomes for a generation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe social contract that was part of American society for many years is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d says Greenwald. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to have a serious conversation about who\xe2\x80\x99s winning and who\xe2\x80\x99s not winning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'",b'\n',"b'September 25, 2012'","b'ONE, we are the zombies! TWO; we are indebted! THREE; this occupation is\xe2\x80\xa6 om-nom nom-nom\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nPlayfully infusing a familiar Occupy Wall Street chant with the mindless noshing of zombies, last June around 100 costumed protesters undertook a \xe2\x80\x9cNight of the Living Debt\xe2\x80\x9d march around the New York University campus and Washington Square Park. The event was organized by All in the Red, an initiative of student activists that grows out of the nocturnal marches that began earlier this summer in solidarity with the massive popular mobilization in Quebec against austerity-related tuition hikes. Equipped with an arsenal of felt red squares, red banners, red balloons, red confetti and pots and pans, the young organizers \xe2\x80\x94 recent graduates of the OWS Summer Disobedience School training program \xe2\x80\x94 undertook the first coordinated march in New York to translate student-specific struggles surrounding tuition and education debt into a broader discourse concerning the perpetual condition of indebtedness in which the 99% currently finds itself. With its necromantic pop-culture reference, the march suggested that zombie-like servitude to Wall Street creditors is a basic condition of life for the majority of the population \xe2\x80\x94 a point driven home with a cathartic \xe2\x80\x9cdebtors\xe2\x80\x99 die-in\xe2\x80\x9d at the conclusion of the event.\nThe Night of the Living Debt march was just one sign that debt is emerging as a connective thread for OWS organizers and their allies as they begin to build toward the movement\xe2\x80\x99s one-year anniversary on September 17, variously known as S17, Black Monday and Occupy Year One. Many organizers in OWS plan to use the media spotlight surrounding the day and its build-up to build what Sandra Nurse calls a \xe2\x80\x9dlaunching pad\xe2\x80\x9d for a new kind of political movement in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 a movement of debtors identifying themselves as such.\nThis is not an entirely new focus. Some of the most prominent initiatives of OWS, and the Occupy movement more broadly, have revolved around the foreclosure crisis, and the Occupy Student Debt Campaign (OSDC) succeeded in drawing national attention to the student debt crisis with 1T Day in April, marking the fact that outstanding student debt has reached $1 trillion. However, these organizing efforts have tended to treat different sectors of debt as single-issue campaigns in isolation from one another. And yet when one looks back to early OWS platforms, such as the 99% Tumblr, one finds that indebtedness of all sorts was already a self-conscious motivation for many participants and sympathizers. As the one-year anniversary approaches, a key question for many organizers is how to forge alliances among groups suffering from and organizing against different kinds of debt-servitude. As OSDC organizer Pamela Brown put it in a June article on Alternet: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are faced with a broken American social contract, and have reached a critical moment for the 99%. Under these circumstances, it seems obvious that a political movement to build a new dream should take debt as its focus.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA major development last spring was the staging of the first New York City Debtors\xe2\x80\x99 Assembly in Washington Square Park on June 11. The format was simple, and the facilitation was minimal. Seated around a banner reading \xe2\x80\x9cStrike Debt\xe2\x80\x9d and adorned with the red felt square familiar from student struggles in Quebec, those assembled were invited to publicly share their \xe2\x80\x9cdebt stories\xe2\x80\x9d with a cardboard \xe2\x80\x9cdebtors\xe2\x80\x99 mic.\xe2\x80\x9d Over two hours, several dozen people from a wide range of backgrounds and generations delivered emotionally charged, first-person testimonials about the experience of debt-servitude to Wall Street and its intermediary institutions. Whether speaking of the ruinous effects of student, credit card, healthcare or mortgage debt, almost all of the speakers remarked that this was their very first time speaking publicly about their status as debtors. To speak as a debtor, and to address others as debtors, was an empowering process in its own right. The simple act of speaking openly built community and solidarity based on a shared experience of breaking with debt-shame \xe2\x80\x94 the insidious sense that to be indebted is an individual moral failure rather than an enforced condition of life under contemporary capitalism. As Shyam Khanna, one of the attendees, put it, the assembly created a space for \xe2\x80\x9cdebtors to find each other, for debtors to become a political subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Debtors\xe2\x80\x99 Assembly was an important development in the overall trajectory of OWS. Lacking a general assembly or a spokescouncil that is empowered to make movement-wide decisions, OWS as it currently stands is a disparate network of working groups, affinity groups and project groups that sometimes overlap and other times work in isolation. Some have lamented that this \xe2\x80\x9cstructureless\xe2\x80\x9d condition contributes to a deadly lack of focus and diffusion of energy, leading some to claim that Occupy as a both a trope and movement has itself been exhausted. Others have seen the post-May Day interregnum as a fruitful period of reflection and reinvention on tactics, strategy, alliances and goals.\nHow Debt Became the Focus\nAmong the most interesting post-May Day experiments were a series of outdoor, outward-facing \xe2\x80\x9cthematic assemblies\xe2\x80\x9d hosted on a weekly basis at Washington Square by the group Occupy Theory (OT), which also publishes Tidal magazine. Avoiding the unwieldy decision-making apparatus of the Zuccotti-era General Assembly, as well as the often insular culture of OWS working groups, the OT assemblies emphasized open-ended reflection on specific political problems. Among the participants in the thematic assemblies were members of Occupy University, Free University Think Tank, F The Banks and the OSDC. One late May assembly focused on the concept of global solidarity in light of the intensifying student struggles in Quebec. From an organic process attuned to developments in New York and around the world came a decision to devote the subsequent assembly to \xe2\x80\x9cEducation and Debt,\xe2\x80\x9d with a focus on building a political movement specifically around the intersection of these terms.\nThe initial OT Education and Debt assembly \xe2\x80\x94 which preceded the full-scale NYC Debtors\xe2\x80\x99 Assembly by a week \xe2\x80\x94 was remarkable for the kind of space it opened up. It wove together the testimonial format with a highly focused conversation about the strategies, tactics, messaging and coalition-building required to make the condition of indebtedness the galvanizing focal point for a full-scale political movement rather than a single-issue campaign. As indicated in the notes from the meeting, which were circulated online throughout OWS social networks, several major questions that have long preoccupied OSDC are in the process of moving to the forefront of OWS as a whole.\nDebt is the tie that binds the 99%. Almost everyone in the United States is a debtor of some sort. Even those excluded from mainstream credit systems are still preyed upon by lending institutions, exemplified by payday loan sharks and pawn shops scattered throughout poor neighborhoods. Rather than a supplementary facet of the overall economy, the personal debt system is a primary engine of Wall Street profits, and it is prone to crisis. Indeed, the student-loan bubble is regarded by many analysts as analogous to the subprime mortgage bubble that led to the crisis of 2008, with a trillion dollars in unpayable loans bundled together and resold by banks through elaborate financial instruments. The debt system is a highly tangible way in which the predatory logic of Wall Street affects the lives of families and communities. And yet, as Chris Kasper of the OWS Arts and Labor group put it in the inaugural assembly, \xe2\x80\x9cEven as it connects us all to global capitalism, debt isolates, atomizes and individuates. The first step is breaking the silence, shedding the fear and creating a space where we can appear together without shame.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMessaging in the Making\nSpeakers in the first assembly drew analogies to the notion of \xe2\x80\x9ccoming out\xe2\x80\x9d in the gay rights movement, in which a new sense of political identity was forged by collectively embracing an otherwise stigmatized individual condition \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cSilence = Debt,\xe2\x80\x9d a play on the famous ACT UP slogan about AIDS, \xe2\x80\x9cSilence = Death,\xe2\x80\x9d has been put forward as a meme, alongside the slogan \xe2\x80\x9cYou Are Not a Loan.\xe2\x80\x9d Another well-received propaganda project to emerge from the debt assemblies has been a sticker reading \xe2\x80\x9cHello, My Debt Is\xe2\x80\xa6,\xe2\x80\x9d designed to resemble a nametag. A large banner has also been produced featuring this design; participants in the debt assemblies are invited to sign the banner with the dollar-amount they owe to creditors, with each signature highlighted by a safety-pinned red felt square of the sort typically affixed to the clothing of protesters.\nAccording to artist Leina Bocar, creator of the participatory banner: \xe2\x80\x9cThe felt square is increasingly recognized in New York as a signature not only of student struggles, but of debtors more generally. It mediates between the intimate scale of the body and the collective scale of the banner, the assembly, and indeed the movement as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLooming over these discussions of debtors\xe2\x80\x99 movement has been the question of a debt strike, a deliberate withdrawal of consent by debtors from the system designed to keep them paying in perpetuity. Millions already do not and cannot pay their debt and are in effect on strike. These de facto debt-strikers constitute what has been described as an \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible army of defaulters\xe2\x80\x9d with massive political potential. Debt strike \xe2\x80\x94 or debt refusal, as OSDC describes it in an online pledge \xe2\x80\x94 is a significant alternative to the notion of debt forgiveness, which has been advocated by some groups rallying around the Student Loan Forgiveness Act. In the words of OSDC member Christopher Casuccio, \xe2\x80\x9cForgiveness, while certainly a noble idea, implies a guilty debtor asking to be freed from its sin. Refusal, on the other hand, is an empowering, collective challenge to an illegitimate and predatory debt-system.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, organized collective refusal is a project requiring long-term research, organizing and support. To simply call for a debt strike without thorough groundwork is unlikely to resonate with debtors already living in fear around their credit ratings and day-to-day survival.\nAn alternative messaging framework that has emerged from these assemblies has been \xe2\x80\x9cStrike Debt\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 variously telegraphed as #strikedebt and DEBT. Playing on the metaphorical possibilities of the word \xe2\x80\x9cstrike,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of Amin Husain, \xe2\x80\x9cStrike Debt opens imaginative space for a wide spectrum of thought and action without limiting a politics of indebtedness to any predetermined model.\xe2\x80\x9d Striking debt here can mean many things; it conjures images of a physical blow against a specified target, or crossing out the tabulation on which crippling debt is registered. Some Strike Debt propaganda depicts the striking of a match, evoking the image of burning debt-statements, an echo of draft-card burning protests of the 1960s and 1970s. The iconic Quebec red square supplemented with the DEBT sign has started to go viral on Facebook.\nThe call to strike debt also incorporates OWS principles of mutual aid. To strike debt would involve legal, financial and cultural infrastructures of support and care for those suffering from indebtedness or deliberately taking the risk of debt refusal. Mutual aid in this sense would be the prefigurative opposite of Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s atomizing, predatory and fear-mongering debt system. An intriguing possible pilot project is a \xe2\x80\x9cdebt fairy\xe2\x80\x9d campaign in which groups of private citizens would pool resources to purchase defaulted debt for pennies on the dollar from banks (who typically sell to collection agencies) liberating the debtor from their burden. While not a structural solution \xe2\x80\x94 and not applicable to student loans \xe2\x80\x94 it could, if implemented on a larger scale, become what David Graeber imagines as a \xe2\x80\x9cmoving jubilee,\xe2\x80\x9d capable of both garnering media attention around debtors\xe2\x80\x99 struggles and taking business away from the intermediary companies that profit from hounding and penalizing those who are unable to pay.\nAs debt provides a gateway into a radical conversation about the capitalist system itself, strategic and analytical questions arise about the role of the state \xe2\x80\x94 questions that have always haunted OWS as a movement grounded in anarchist principles. What can we learn from the debt cancellation forced upon the Icelandic government by citizens earlier this year? How do we connect the dots between \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal\xe2\x80\x9d debt and the public debt of municipalities and governments subjected to corporate bondholders and credit-rating agencies? How do we link struggles against budgetary austerity with the grievances of the indebted? As Andrew Ross asked on Democracy Now! last fall, \xe2\x80\x9cHow might debt be rethought as something socially productive and collectively managed, rather than as an engine of predatory profiteering for the 1%?\xe2\x80\x9d\nCan we think beyond existing models of public finance, planning and infrastructure toward something closer to the ideal of \xe2\x80\x9cthe commons\xe2\x80\x9d? Activist and New York University professor Nick Mirzoeff speculates, if \xe2\x80\x9cslavery\xe2\x80\x9d to debt were abolished, what would a subsequent \xe2\x80\x9cReconstruction\xe2\x80\x9d process look like? For ordinary people to delve into these questions is empowering in its own right, and for OWS they will continue to be explored through public assembly and direct action of the sort that began at Liberty Square last September.\nThe physical tactic of occupation first deployed on Sept. 17 of last year, is unlikely to be replicated, but the spaces of education, empowerment and imagination created by Occupy remain open. Debtors \xe2\x80\x94 which is to say, the 99% \xe2\x80\x94 are poised to step out of the shadows and into that space, providing it with the content and focus required for what was once a precarious encampment to evolve into a sustainable social movement.\nAn earlier version of this article appeared on waginingnonviolence.org.\nStudent Debt By the Numbers\n\n\t\tTotal amount of student debt in U.S.: Over $1 trillion\n\n\t\tAverage amount of student debt per person: $24,301\n\n\t\tThe amount of past-due student loan balances: $85 billion\n\n\t\tPercentage of families with education debt in 2010: 19.2 percent\n(Sources: Bloomberg Business Week, Washington Post, U.S. News & World Report, New York Times, Federal Reserve Bank of New York)\nBeyond Student Debt\n\n\t\tTotal amount of credit card debt in the U.S.: $693 billion\n\n\t\tTotal amount of automobile debt in the U.S.: $730 billion\n\n\t\tAverage amount of credit card debt per household: Almost $16,000\n\n\t\tPercentage of low and middle-income Americans who use their credit cards to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses: 50 percent\n\n\t\tPercentage of 19 to 29-year-olds having difficulty paying medical bills or medical debt: 36 percent\n(Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, PR Newswire, Huffington Post, CNN Money)\n\xe2\x80\x94 Karen Okamoto & Tony D\xe2\x80\x99Souza\n'",b'\n',"b'November 1, 2012'","b'At an October 2008 Obama rally, Peggy Joseph, a black woman, held a palm to her chest and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about putting gas in my car. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about paying my mortgage. If I help him, he\xe2\x80\x99ll help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFour years later at an October 2012 town hall debate an older black man, Michael Jones, said to the president, \xe2\x80\x9cI voted for you but today I\xe2\x80\x99m not that optimistic. Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive.\xe2\x80\x9d At debate\xe2\x80\x99s end, Obama walked offstage; a man whose election had electrified the world, now hung by fingertips to a slight lead in the polls.\nThe contrast between Obama the symbol and Obama the capitalist CEO has created our political crisis. For nearly 70 million U.S. voters and the millions who danced in the global street festivals of election night, he was living a dream. Today the West is on the edge of collapse. And the return of political apathy leaves people like Peggy Joseph and Michael Jones more vulnerable than before. If former Gov. Mitt Romney wins the presidency, he\xe2\x80\x99ll dismantle the New Deal. If Obama wins he\xe2\x80\x99ll make a Grand Bargain with Republicans to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay down the 16 trillion dollar federal deficit. Either way, no sustained public counter force\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 not even Occupy Wall Street \xe2\x80\x94 exists to block Republican greed or Obama\xe2\x80\x99s vain need for a legacy. How did we get here?\nPOLITICS IS A SITE OF TRANSFERENCE\nWhen you were young, did you believe in Santa Claus? As an adult, did you ever kneel and pray furiously to God? Did you feel like the Lord could see right through you and take away the weight of your secrets?\nMany of us have experienced belief in someone who knows us better than we know ourselves. We outgrow the childish versions of it but the need to feel lifted from our lives stays with us, as does its opposite, the nightmare of being under surveillance by someone who knows our transgressions.\nIn adulthood that belief returns when a patient greets a therapist and nervous hope tingles in the handshake. He or she believes the analyst can read the secret of the confused pain s/he carries. It\xe2\x80\x99s that hope that begins the transference, a key of psychoanalytic treatment, in which patients talk, reenact memories, and project repressed desires onto the therapist, who plays the Subject Supposed to Know.\nThe need to believe in someone larger than ourselves drives our politics. In the 2008 presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama openly talked of being not a black man so much as a \xe2\x80\x9cblank\xe2\x80\x9d man on which people projected their desires. When he first appeared on TVs across America, few cared, and initially Black America was skeptical. It was only after he seemed to know how to \xe2\x80\x9cread\xe2\x80\x9d whites that they, and soon a majority of voters, transferred onto him buried wishes for equal representation.\nEvery ideology or theology creates its own specific Subject Supposed to Know, a mythic figure that sums up the reality of its worldview by embodying it in flesh and bone. And we need this because human knowledge is innately inter-subjective. We often believe in gossip, political ideas or theories not because we know them to be true but out of our need to be desired by those who believe in them. Maybe a mother or father, maybe a teacher or pastor, maybe a friend or lover; whoever they are, we need them. So often, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the truth of an idea that gives it credibility, but the fact that it is cherished by another whom we desire. The Subject Supposed to Know in its various versions is the guarantee of the truth of a knowledge, precisely because its validity is in the end not knowable, only our passionate need to believe is.\nAmerican liberalism had a Subject Supposed to Know; it was a unifier, someone who would solve class conflict by appealing to the \xe2\x80\x9cbetter angels of our nature.\xe2\x80\x9d And the prophetic tradition of the black church anticipated a \xe2\x80\x9cJoshua\xe2\x80\x9d figure that could complete the work of Moses-like Martin Luther King, who brought the people to the edge of a Promised Land that he could not enter. Both of these figures were merged and projected onto Obama.\nHe seemed to have a guaranteed knowledge of how to bring a nation fractured by racism, sexism and class together, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the trick of transference. The Subject Supposed to Know never actually does anything \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s the belief that they do that lifts a patient\xe2\x80\x99s or voter\xe2\x80\x99s buried desire to the surface. So when voters blinked, they saw not Obama the symbol but Obama the corporate liberal who in policy terms is farther right than Richard Nixon.\nTHE SUBJECT SUPPOSED TO FEAR\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one\xe2\x80\x99s ever asked to see my birth certificate,\xe2\x80\x9d Romney joked at a campaign stop in August. The audience laughed that this rich white man contrasted himself with the \xe2\x80\x9csecret\xe2\x80\x9d Kenyan, Muslim Obama. They laughed at the not-so-coded racism. And they laughed at the millions of immigrants, gays, non-Christians, poor and brown people who stood behind Obama wanting to be Americans in full.\nRomney\xe2\x80\x99s use of code words signals to his supporters that he reads the secret desires boiling inside them, how they want special representation as \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d Americans. But when the rally ends, white working-class Republican voters return to a grim reality. It is the stress of endless bills, broken schools, falling life expectancy, low or no pay and the shame of welfare, all of which is traumatizing when contrasted against the promise of upward mobility. Add to that the loss of the \xe2\x80\x9cwages of whiteness,\xe2\x80\x9d the privileges that sustained one\xe2\x80\x99s status in the absence of a high-paying job. Add to it the Muslim, black, Latino or Asian families moving across the street, who look to the first black president as their hero.\nWhen the white working poor look through their windows, they don\xe2\x80\x99t see their real neighbor but the Subject Supposed to be Feared. It\xe2\x80\x99s a term cultural critic Slavoj iek used to describe the tales of black criminality during the flood of New Orleans, accounts that were not true but served as a guarantee of one\xe2\x80\x99s racist mythology. It is the nightmare figure created by Fox News and talk radio that flows in code down from the business class of the Republican Party and is translated into the crude vitriol of Red State America.\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if Romney is not a real believer. Few voters think he is. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter because they\xe2\x80\x99ll believe for him. They just need for him to give coded signals that he sees what they see, the Subject Supposed to be Feared, the nightmare Other, climbing the gates of the City on a Hill, trying to force entry and steal the back the land.\nTHE QUESTIONED FUTURE\nToo often, political transference blinds. It is a theater built on top of a national puzzle of voting districts, filled with people whose emotional life is translated into the mythos of a political ideology. Many don\xe2\x80\x99t see the system driving the world but only the mirrors held up by officials that reflect our dreams or nightmares. Behind the theater is a structural dynamic of a global capitalist system, whose Western epicenters are in crisis after switching from manufacturing to financial services. After trading in abstract housing debt, the West \xe2\x80\x94 specifically Europe \xe2\x80\x94 has cratered.\nHere in the United Sates 12 million are unemployed, nearly 9 million are part-time and 2 million have stopped looking. It adds up to 23 million who are on the edge of poverty if they have not already fallen in. And this is what\xe2\x80\x99s called the New Normal; the United States has added millions more who are sinking into social invisibility to its already permanent underclass.\nThey scrounge for a bed, they root through the garbage for food, they numb themselves with drink or drugs, they die in the cold and many burn with the memory that just a few years ago they had a home, a job, a life. In 2008, the U.S. poverty rate was 13 percent or about 40 million. In 2011 it spiked to 15 percent or 46 million people. And not one of our presidential candidates will say their names or even say that it\xe2\x80\x99s a crisis or that people are dying.\nAdd to this the criminalization of the poor. A recent New York Times article reported, citing a National Law Center survey of 243 cities that \xe2\x80\x9c40 percent prohibited camping, 33 percent banned sitting and lying down in public places and 53 percent outlawed begging.\xe2\x80\x9d Other cities banned people who smell bad from going into libraries or parking shopping carts near entrances. Add to it the violence visited on the poor, the endless stop-and-frisks and brutal police beatings, of which one example is the killing of Kelly Thomas, a mentally ill homeless man seen in a grainy black and white video being choked, kicked and murdered.\nOur politicians are creating a conveyor belt from poverty to prison. The private prison industry hires lobbyists to pay off politicians. Last year the Associated Press reported that three major private prison industries paid $45 million in campaign donations. In exchange, politicians pass laws like Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s anti-immigrant SB1070; 30 of the 36 co-sponsors received campaign donations from the private prison industry.\nUndocumented workers, mostly Mexican, grip the cell bars, jangling in cuffs to the bus where they are taken across the border to hear phone calls from panicked families. The new poor, jailed for begging or sleeping in parks, are released only to become part of the New Jim Crow, stigmatized with prison time so they can get no work, no housing, no love, nothing.\nAdd to this that in 2050 we are projected to be at 400 million citizens. We will be grayer. Twenty percent of the United States will be 65 or older. We will be browner. Latinos alone will comprise 30 percent of the population. Collectively, people of color will breach the 50 percent mark and whites will no longer be the majority.\nIf the New Normal becomes just \xe2\x80\x9cnormal,\xe2\x80\x9d if the job market only grows fast enough to absorb the increase in population but no more, then the role of government will become a charged question. Does it have a responsibility to create work or not? How the public answers this will depend on how mass political will is mobilized. And one aspect of that, aside from the on-the-ground organizing is: who is the Subject Supposed to Know that the people will transfer their desires onto?\nSTARVING THE BEAST\nSeeing the future, Republicans are trying \xe2\x80\x9cto shrink government down to the size where we can drown it in a bathtub.\xe2\x80\x9d The tactic is called \xe2\x80\x9cStarving the Beast;\xe2\x80\x9d the phrase came from an 1985 article in the Wall Street Journal quoting a Reagan administration official. The tactic is to cut taxes, especially on the wealthy, and then run up the deficit. When the federal budget is squeezed they turn around and demand cuts in social programs.\nNo wonder Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns were loaded with coded racism; he reveled in telling white working-class audiences about \xe2\x80\x9cwelfare queens\xe2\x80\x9d who drove Cadillacs on their way to pick up their government checks. It is a tactic repeated by Republicans everywhere, all the time. President George\xc2\xa0 H.W. Bush did it with the infamous Willie Horton ad and recently Newt Gingrich did it by labeling Obama the \xe2\x80\x9cfood stamp\xe2\x80\x9d president. By invoking the Subject Supposed to\xc2\xa0 be Feared, the black criminal, the foreign Other, they can terrify white working-class voters into viewing the government as the tool of the internal enemy, which is why the recent imagery depicting President Obama as Hitler setting up Death Panels resonates.\nDemocracy is the avenue through which the New American Majority, brown, young and Spanish speaking, can use the state. The conservative goal is to kill the federal government, decentralizing power to private companies until the United States is a network of near-feudal corporate city-states, protected from an impoverished people by a bloated police force and if need be, the military. And the way to enact this vision is through the politics of fear.\nTHE SUBJECT SUPPOSED TO SAVE\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to put 25 million people back to work,\xe2\x80\x9d Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein said, \xe2\x80\x9cthrough a Green new Deal.\xe2\x80\x9d She cites the $700 billion bailout given to banks and says an amount that size could be channeled to direct job creation. So the question is why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\nPolitical will is created through transference, which itself needs a figure who can guarantee our knowledge of ourselves, as in Obama, or of the outside world, as in conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 mythic black criminal. In order to mobilize the public to push for a Green Deal, a narrative frame will be needed for the victims of climate change.\nOne option is the Subject Supposed to be Feared, one predicted and prepared for by the Pentagon in a report on the security risks of a world destabilized by climate change. In the next 20 or 30 years, floods, shortages of food and clean water and storms could send millions of people into exile from their homes. And inside the United States, storms and droughts and soaring food prices will force the public to see once again the poor and vulnerable that have been made invisible. The question is how will they be seen? Will they be framed as dangerous, ragged hordes climbing over the walls?\nThe other option is the Subject Supposed to Save, figures of innocent suffering whose dilemma is not their fault. And that\xe2\x80\x99s key, because the conservative frame of the poor posits that their poverty is due to\n\ttheir culture.\nWith New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, both narratives competed, but ultimately the thousands of black homeless people were viewed as innocent and thereby eligible for our sympathy. As the planet boils, floods hit, storms ravage and land dries up, those represented by the figure of the Subject Supposed to Save will become vital in political debates. The purity of their pain will guarantee their knowledge of what is real compassion. And we who are safe but guilty for being so will see in them our secret desire for absolution answered.\nTHE GREEN MILE\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard the saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWithout a vision, the people perish.\xe2\x80\x9d As the election nears, Obama dashes around the country, offering tepid liberalism. He strains to give voters his vision of tomorrow, but real political power runs in reverse. People have to transfer their desires outside of themselves and see them materialized. And polls show that voters want universal healthcare, the end of war, legalized marijuana, clean energy and funding for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Many Americans are more radical than their leaders, they just don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way out, and without a vision they stumble in the dark.\n'",b'\n',"b'November 1, 2012'","b'Is the Republican Party trying to commit suicide?\nDespite well-publicized demographic trends predicting that the United States will become a \xe2\x80\x9cminority-majority\xe2\x80\x9d nation by 2042, Republicans have been conducting a vigorous slash-and-burn campaign against African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans.\nBy late August, there had been enough racially tinged attacks on President Obama that NBC/Wall Street Journal polling reported an astounding zero percent of African-Americans expressing support for Romney. After the Republican nominee was exposed for joking about the political advantages he would have if he could claim Latino heritage, his support among Latinos dropped from a high of 31 percent after the GOP convention down to 24 percent, according to a LatinoDecision/ImpreMedia poll. And, although the number of Native Americans is relatively small, the Republican tomahawk chops and war whoops used to jeer Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren have dismayed many in Indian Country.\nThe fact is, it is difficult to sell the Republican agenda to communities with high unemployment rates, high incarceration rates, and higher than average rates of foreclosures. Spending cuts, tax cuts and the unqualified opposition to healthcare reform and regulations on Wall Street are not popular ideas in poor communities of color. Voter suppression is not working too well either, nor is the Republican block against the Dream Act. There is not a lot of rhetorical room to maneuver here, and no obvious \xe2\x80\x9cspin\xe2\x80\x9d that might paint this policy agenda as representing the interests of all Americans.\nRepublican political analysts have to know the demographic changes that are coming, which leads one to wonder: is there a logic to the GOP\xe2\x80\x99s madness, or have they just decided to go down fighting as the last (almost) all-white party?\nECONOMIC INTERESTS\nRomney\xe2\x80\x99s white working-class and poor supporters should also see their economic interests endangered by the Republican agenda and a candidate known for breaking up companies and bragging that he \xe2\x80\x9clikes\xe2\x80\x9d to fire people. The largest numbers of poor people in the United States are white, and many of them are among the 47 percent scorned by Romney.\nYet the Republican candidate continues to enjoy a majority of the white vote (by 53 percent to 40 percent). He also has a majority of the senior vote (49 percent to 41 percent) and the rural vote (47 percent to 38 percent), two other groups that have rational reasons to dislike the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 attitude toward everything from Social Security and Medicare to closing rural post offices.\nThe Republicans apparently need no spin to make these groups feel represented. Why?\nPOWER OF MYTH\nIn November 2010, when Republicans swept the midterm elections a bare two years after Obama\xe2\x80\x99s historic win, The New York Times ran a front-page article assessing four possible explanations for the Republican triumph. Not one concerned race.\nJust recently, Columbia University Professor of Humanities Mark Lilla wrote a critical review of Charles Kesler\xe2\x80\x99s newly published conservative screed, I Am the Change: Barack Obama and the Crisis of Liberalism, in which Kesler offers the reasoned arguments, so to speak, for conservative dislike and distrust of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of social welfare programs. Kesler scrupulously avoids the issue of race, but surprisingly, so does Lilla, who offers no real rejoinder to Kesler\xe2\x80\x99s explanations other than to show how they are based in myth rather than fact. The question remains, why do the myths hold such sway?\nNumerous theorists are beginning to explore the topic of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather than predict votes by rational choice theory applied to interest-group politics, we need to pay more attention to the feelings evoked by a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s language and style. This is not quite the dog-whistle idea, that coded messages are sent to the faithful through subtle word choice, but that feelings themselves can be mobilized to affect behavioral\n\tchoices by giving people new ideas about who is their ally and who is their enemy and what the payoff of a particular policy agenda will be on their emotional well-\n\tbeing and their sense of pride and importance and value.\nRETHINKING AYN RAND\nConsider the feelings evoked by Ayn Rand\xe2\x80\x99s blockbuster novel, Atlas Shrugged, a book whose sales are second only to the Bible and whose fervent followers famously include vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan. New York University sociology professor Lisa Duggan suggests we think about Rand\xe2\x80\x99s novel not in terms of its terrible writing or its cartoonish plotlines or its absurd empirical claims about what makes capitalist societies work; rather we should look at its highly sexualized and exciting portrayal of the greed-obsessed entrepreneur. Rand\xe2\x80\x99s novel presents a contrast not only of political options but also of emotional personalities. On the one side we have the staid and domesticated forces that support regulation, empathy, and self-sacrifice, coded maternal and feminine, while on the other side we have the arousal of a masculine rebel who lives by his creative wits, the collective be damned. The choice is vanilla sex or transgression, but gender identity, pride, self-esteem and the possibility of exhilaration are also at stake.\nWhat would you choose?\nWe need to expand our thinking about rational judgment and understand that our emotional lives constitute a self-interest too. This is not an argument that the masses are hopelessly irrational. We are all motivated by our feelings. The idea that rational minds can transcend feelings is based on a myth of objective distancing that has its own emotional payoff in feelings of inviolability and security. The Republicans may be banking on their capacity to mobilize feelings even when their policy proposals make no economic sense for the 99 percent, much less the 47 percent. Whites are not the only group susceptible to the appeal of American exceptionalism, or the masculine ethos of hyper self-sufficiency espoused by randy Randians who stride about asserting absolutes without apology or qualification.\n\xc2\xa0\n'",b'\n',"b'November 1, 2012'","b'Tens of millions of Americans tuned in to the three presidential debates that took place during October, with the last one held on Oct. 22. But what voters didn\xe2\x80\x99t see are the third-party alternatives to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, who for all the minor differences between them share a similar vision of a corporate state that caters to the rich, strip mines our environment and wages endless war.\nIn New York, four third-party candidates will be on the ballot. Their views provide a refreshing counterpoint to the stale debate Americans have been treated to during the past year and a half of the presidential campaign.\nJILL STEIN, GREEN PARTY\nA physician, an environmental activist and a former Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate who debated Mitt Romney in 2002, Jill Stein is bringing her message of full employment and Medicare for all to millions of voters this year. Stein and her running mate, a formerly homeless anti-poverty activist named Cheri Honkala, will be on the ballot in at least 37 states come November. Both Stein and Honkala support the Occupy Wall Street movement. \xe2\x80\x9c[The] machine that is driving our economy and our climate over the cliff is bought and paid for by Wall Street,\xe2\x80\x9d Stein told Mother Jones on the first anniversary of OWS. To counter this, Stein\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is calling for a \xe2\x80\x9cGreen New Deal.\xe2\x80\x9d Inspired by Franklin Delano Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s New Deal, the Green Party\xe2\x80\x99s version calls for massive, government-led investments with a goal of full employment and a transition to a post-carbon economy based on renewable energy sources. Stein is also calling for financial reform and the breakup of big banks and measures to democratize U.S. politics. Other parts of the Green Party platform include rejecting cuts to Medicare and Social Security; tuition-free education; a moratorium on foreclosures and evictions; and the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.

Lindsay is only 28, but she has a wealth of social justice organizing under her belt. A graduate of Howard University, Lindsay cut her teeth doing anti-war organizing in the aftermath of September 11. She was a youth leader with the ANSWER Coalition (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) and a founding member of the Party for Socialism and Liberation. Her running mate, Yari Osorio, is a Colombian-born U.S. citizen who is an organizer with ANSWER and an Occupy activist. In addition to New York, Lindsay and Osorio are on the ballot in 12 other states.\nAs the centerpiece of her campaign, Lindsay calls for expropriating the largest private banks and creating a people\xe2\x80\x99s bank that would fund a jobs program, cancel student debt, provide free education and end all foreclosures. The PSL candidate also wants to shut down all U.S. military bases around the globe, halt police brutality, abolish all anti-immigrant laws and implement full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. For more, see pslweb.org.\nGARY JOHNSON, LIBERTARIAN PARTY\nUnder the banner of \xe2\x80\x9cminimum government, maximum freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d Libertarians oppose overseas military actions like the war in Afghanistan, call for the end of the Drug War and support marriage equality. They also want to do away with income taxes, government social programs and government regulation of everything from clean air and water to shady Wall Street practices. Their standard bearer this year is Gary Johnson, a former two-term governor of New Mexico who trumpets his fiscal conservatism everywhere he goes. Johnson briefly contended for the Republican presidential nomination but dropped out in late 2011 to become the Libertarian Party presidential nominee. His running mate, James Gray, is a former judge and an ardent Drug War critic. The Libertarian ticket will be on the ballot in at least 47 states. Johnson and Gray are hoping to steal some of Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s supporters now that the libertarian idol has dropped out of the presidential race.\nVIRGIL GOODE, CONSTITUTION PARTY\nFor Tea Party types dissatisfied with Mitt Romney, Virgil Goode might be their man. A former six-term congressman from southern Virginia, Goode made headlines in 2006 after criticizing Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, for using the Qu\xe2\x80\x99ran during his swearing-in ceremony. A year later he warned from the floor of Congress of \xe2\x80\x9cradical Muslims\xe2\x80\x9d who want to control the world and put \xe2\x80\x9cIn Muhammad We Trust\xe2\x80\x9d on U.S. currency.\nThese days, Goode is the standard bearer for the Constitution Party, a right-wing, religiously conservative party that champions deep cuts in government spending and an end to almost all immigration. Goode and his running mate Jim Clymer are also opposed to gay marriage and abortion and want to end international trade agreements. Like the other third parties on New York\xe2\x80\x99s ballot, the Constitution Party rejects U.S. intervention around the world. Goode and Clymer will appear on the ballot in at least 25 states.\nSix Third Party Candidates to Remember\n\n\tVICTORIA WOODHULL\n\t(1872)\n\tEQUAL RIGHTS PARTY\nVictoria Woodhull shocked the patriarchal assumptions of America\xe2\x80\x99s political and media establishment when she leapt into the 1872 presidential race as the candidate of the Equal Rights Party. Already the first woman to publish a newspaper in the United States, Woodhull was a fierce advocate for women\xe2\x80\x99s sexual autonomy and the right of women to divorce their husbands. Tarred by the press as the \xe2\x80\x9cfree love\xe2\x80\x9d candidate, Woodhull was jailed days before the election by the New York City police. There is no record of how many votes she received or even whether they were counted.\nJAMES WEAVER\n\t(1892)\n\tPOPULIST PARTY\nFired by the grievances of small farmers against Eastern bankers and railroad monopolies, the Populist movement swept across large swaths of the South, West and Great Plains in the late 1880s. It reach its high point in 1892 when Populist Party presidential candidate James Weaver received more than 1 million votes and won five states. The Populists faded out of existence within a few years but some of the causes they championed including the graduated income tax, direct election of senators, initiative, referendum and recall were all later enacted.\nGEORGE EDWIN TAYLOR\n\t(1904)\n\tNATIONAL NEGRO LIBERTY PARTY\nThe son of a former slave, George Edwin Taylor was a Iowa-based labor leader and newspaper publisher who left the Democratic Party in 1904 to become the first black to run for the White House. Taylor won few votes but his candidacy showed that an independent black politics was possible at a time when both major parties were embracing the establishment of the Jim Crow system.\nEUGENE DEBS\n\t(1904, 1908, 1912, 1920)\n\tSOCIALIST PARTY\nA former railroad workers union leader, Eugene Debs received 6 percent of the vote in 1912, the high-water mark for the Socialist Party. Debs and other socialists were targeted by the government for opposing U.S. entry into World War I as a \xe2\x80\x9ccapitalist war.\xe2\x80\x9d Debs received a 10-year prison sentence for speaking out against the draft and ran his last presidential campaign in 1920 from a federal prison cell in Atlanta from which he managed to garner more than 900,000 votes.\nGEORGE WALLACE\n\t(1968)\n\tAMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY\nThird-party campaigns can help move marginal ideas into the mainstream. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they are always progressive ones. In 1968, Alabama Gov. George Wallace ran as the candidate of the white backlash against the civil rights movement, winning more than 13 percent of the national vote and five Southern states. Wallace also fared well in parts of the North, prefiguring the rise of white ethnic \xe2\x80\x9cReagan Democrats\xe2\x80\x9d who would help propel the conservative movement to power in\n\tthe 1980s.\nRALPH NADER\n\t(2000)\n\tGREEN PARTY\nRiding the wave of protests following the November 1999 \xe2\x80\x9cBattle of Seattle,\xe2\x80\x9d legendary anti-corporate crusader Ralph Nader ran a spirited third party campaign that filled arenas with thousands of cheering supporters and brought the Green Party into the national spotlight for the first time. Many Democrats blame Nader for costing Al Gore Florida\xe2\x80\x99s 25 electoral votes and the presidency. Others note that Gore still would have won if he had taken his home state of Tennessee or fought harder to prevent Republican dirty tricks during the Florida recount process.\n\xe2\x80\x94 JOHN TARLETON\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\tRIGGING BALLOT ACCESS\nThe two major-party candidates both receive around-the-clock media coverage and have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal. As if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, the election game is skewed by ballot access laws enacted by Republican and Democratic lawmakers that vary state by state but make getting on the ballot an arduous process for third-party candidates.\nIn New York, candidates could automatically get on the ballot this year if their parties had received at least 50,000 votes during the last gubernatorial election in 2010. A third party can also gain access to the ballot if candidates collect at least 15,000 valid signatures during a five-week stretch in the middle of the summer with at least 100 signatures each coming from at least half of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 27 congressional districts.\nOther states are worse. Georgia requires a candidate to garner 1 percent of the total amount of eligible registered voters from last election. This year, that\xe2\x80\x99s about 58,000 signatures. In North Carolina, candidates have to collect signatures equal to 2 percent of the total votes cast in the last governor\xe2\x80\x99s election or about 85,000 signatures. The worst offender? That\xe2\x80\x99s probably Oklahoma. The Sooner State requires a third party to get signatures of registered voters that equal at least five percent of the votes cast for the office at the top of the previous statewide election, or this year almost 52,000 signatures in a sparsely inhabited state with one fifth the population of New York.\n\xe2\x80\x94A.K.\n'",b'\n',"b'November 1, 2012'","b'President Obama cannot tell a lie \xe2\x80\x94 at least not according to his Department of Justice. The department changed tactics after a dramatic Sept. 12 ruling by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest declar\xe2\x80\xa2ing unconstitutional the portion of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that authorizes indefinite detention without trial of those who \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially support ... forces engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or its coalition partners.\xe2\x80\x9d Forrest had granted a permanent injunction against the enforcement of this statute in a First Amendment suit brought by Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg and other activists against the 2012 NDAA. Judge Forrest was forced to issue this unusual constitutional ruling at a pre-trial stage of the lawsuit because of the tactics of the administration lawyers, who flatly refused to address Judge Forrest\xe2\x80\x99s questions about who might be subject to detention under the vague wording of the act. After being stone\xe2\x80\xa2walled five times by the Department of Justice lawyers, she reluctantly concluded that Hedges, who has interviewed and quoted members of Hamas and other designated terror\xe2\x80\xa2ists for his books, faced the possibil\xe2\x80\xa2ity of running afoul of the law without knowing how to avoid its provisions.\nHowever, in its pre-trial appeal of Forrest\xe2\x80\x99s injunction, the government changed tactics and asserted that it had no inten\xe2\x80\xa2tion of prosecuting journalists or organizers such as Kai Wargalla, an activist on behalf of Julian Assange. The fact that the DoJ of\xe2\x80\xa2fered this assertion only on appeal, only af\xe2\x80\xa2ter District Judge Forrest held a hearing on the constitutional dangers, is unbecoming at best. It is unseemly for government lawyers to change their theory of the case mid-stream, and it is improper for any lawyer to offer new facts at the appeals stage, as it is the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s role to determine facts and decide who is telling the truth.\nAs previously reported on The Indypen\xe2\x80\xa2dent\xe2\x80\x99s website (Sept. 28), Judge Forrest gave the government ample opportunity to state that it did not interpret the NDAA as au\xe2\x80\xa2thorizing the detention of persons engaged in classic First Amendment activities like reporting and demonstrating. This ques\xe2\x80\xa2tion was clearly before Judge Forrest who, as a federal judge, was well aware of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project and its potential for criminalizing even legal advice as \xe2\x80\x9cmate\xe2\x80\xa2rial support.\xe2\x80\x9d So it must be concluded that the DoJ\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to answer her question of what \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially support\xe2\x80\x9d means in this case was deliberate strategy on the part of the Obama Administration.\nThis should give us all pause as it means the administration is truly seeking the vast expansion of executive power that the vagueness in the law would enable.\nThis unusual showdown between the ex\xe2\x80\xa2ecutive branch and the judiciary is all the more galling be\xe2\x80\xa2cause of the bait-and-switch, forcing a constitutional ruling from the Dis\xe2\x80\xa2trict Judge and then backpedaling in the Appeals Court. As a practical matter, Judge Forrest, to whom the case will be returned for further development of the record, will now be very hard pressed to hold the government\xe2\x80\x99s earlier assertions (or, in the face of the stakes at hand, non-assertions) against it. She will almost certainly have to give Obama a pass and accept its belated statements of good intentions. Unfortunately for the plaintiffs and for activists and journalists, the government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cswitch in time\xe2\x80\x9d will deprive Judge Forrest of a basis to issue a constitutional ruling. What the government had allowed to develop into a clear confrontation will now likely fail for lack of proof that the jour\xe2\x80\xa2nalists are likely be detained in the future.\n'",b'\n',"b'November 1, 2012'","b'PEACE, OUT: Mike Hastie, Vietnam War Army medic (1970-71), was among 25 arrested for being at Vietnam Veterans Memorial Plaza after its official closing time Oct. 7.

On the website, it was a white spiral as if someone unplugged a drain in the sky and the clouds swirled down. It spun over the Caribbean, leaving a trail of dark battered islands in its wake. I watched the tally of the dead rise; in Jamaica, one dead; in Haiti, 54 dead and Cuba, 11 dead.\nAnd yet, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it seriously. It\xe2\x80\x99ll peter out. The window-shaking wind seemed like fun. I laughed with Mom over the phone as the sky darkened and rain scraped the street like a Brillo pad. She was going to the evacuation center but had to waterproof things in her apartment first. And then her phone cut off.\nNew York stumbled after Hurricane Sandy like someone roughhousing with a friend and caught a surprising elbow to the eye. We flicked useless light switches, turned on dead computers and stared at trees piled in the street. Mom was on Staten Island in a basement apartment near the shore and I imagined her being carried away in the flood. Where was she? Does she have food, water? Did she get to the center in time?\nAnd then she sent a text, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who live behind me have died, including two children who were swept away from their mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms. I watched as police boats brought out bodies from my street.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe next day, I drove a U-Haul van down Father Capodanno Boulevard in Staten Island, eyeing the ripped telephone poles, moldy furniture piled on the street, metal gates twisted like coat hangers. And then I saw her. I parked the van, jumped out and instantly she wept as I wrapped my arms around her.\nInside the carpet squished underfoot, I was stunned at the sight of Mom\xe2\x80\x99s whole life in a dark wet pile. Nothing was salvageable. \xe2\x80\x9cYour high school graduation photo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said and held up a soggy picture of me smiling in a blue robe.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMom,\xe2\x80\x9d I sighed, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s say good-bye to this. Let it go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated as she picked up photos that crumbled into smaller and smaller pieces. \xe2\x80\x9cWait.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTHE AFTERMATH\n\tShe takes anti-anxiety pills. Sometimes, she wakes up in the night to watch Netflix until sleep overtakes her again. She blames herself for renting in Staten Island. She feels calm when folding clothes and putting them into my closet. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d she huffs, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like everything keeps shaking inside me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWatching Mom go through stages of loss, shock, self-blame, grief and the re-assembling of life, I see in her the people I interviewed in 2005, driven out of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. I see again the ragged homeless of Haiti I talked to, living in tents after the 2010 earthquake. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same magnitude. She\xe2\x80\x99s physically fine. No broken bones, no amputations. She can stay with me. She has insurance to replace the car. But they share the same panicked face, the same worry, fear and helpless clutching at whatever or whoever is stable enough to hold.\nForty-thousand New Yorkers lost their homes. But they are in a First-World city where resources are closer at hand. Just do the simplest search on Wikipedia, enter \xe2\x80\x9cEnvironment Migrant\xe2\x80\x9d and you will read of 42 million people in Asia and the Pacific made homeless by storms that lashed the land, cold fronts that killed crops, rising seas that lapped tides against front doors. By 2050 the number of climate refugees could climb to 150 million people. Immense rivers of people flowing over national borders, lugging rice bags, balancing luggage on their heads, gaunt and bleak-eyed. They\xe2\x80\x99ll follow their hunger, search for safety and be corralled by the military into camps where they will live in legal limbo. Each one, I can imagine waking at night, panicked and trying to find someone or something that is stable enough to hold.\nAnd where will they go? And just as important to ask is, what of their stories? The narrative geography of our imagined community, who we \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d as our neighbor is created by a global media filtering them through an ideological screen. In the left mythos, they are the deserving poor, whose suffering reflects our own subjective position of Good Samaritans. In the right mythos they are undeserving hordes who threaten civilization. And we saw this play out in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.\nNew Yorkers solemnly nodded when told about Gotham\xe2\x80\x99s climate refugees. They were victims whose homelessness was not their fault. But beneath the sympathy were long lines of angry people at gas stations, angry apartment dwellers who ate cold food in the dark, families piled on top of each other in small rooms. The city\xe2\x80\x99s nerves were frayed. When Mayor Bloomberg visited Far Rockaway, people cursed him and demanded help. He nervously repeated the litany of the legitimacy of the state. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is working as hard as they can,\xe2\x80\x9d Bloomberg said, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are not always going to get as many things as they want as fast as they want them.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey weren\xe2\x80\x99t asking for what they wanted, they were asking for what they needed \xe2\x80\x94 water, food, medicine. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s condescending rhetoric repeated the sliding scale of dehumanization that is the tactic of the ruling class. First, frame the people as children who want too much, too fast. Second, if they push too hard, if they take instead of waiting, criminalize them like Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, who said in 2005 as the people of New Orleans died of hunger, \xe2\x80\x9cI have one message for these hoodlums: These troops know how to shoot and kill, and they are more than willing to do so if necessary, and I expect they will.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhat if after Hurricane Sandy the gas lines got longer, store shelves were empty and power never came back? What if we were driven by hunger to break laws to survive? How long would it take for us to rush the stores? Who would we become?\nThe awful truth is the refugee and the criminal are defined by their need; they share a speculative identity, divided primarily by which side of the law they\xe2\x80\x99re on. As the seas rise and deserts grow like a burn scar across nations, the means of survival will clash with the relations of ownership. The laws that bind the 7 billion people on the planet into a capitalist pyramid scheme will force the poorest across the line from citizens to refugees to criminals. And they will walk straight into the cross-hairs of the military, into the prisons, into the abyss.\nDays after the hurricane, I was helping Mom up the stairs when my friend called. He was afraid of putting his car in the garage. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I leave it there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSome asshole is going to siphon the gas out of my tank. It\xe2\x80\x99s\n\talready been happening.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWE WHO ARE DARKER THAN BLUE\n\tOn the night President Obama was elected, Fox host Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a traditional America anymore. People want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama. \xe2\x80\xa6The voters, many of them, feel like the economic system is stacked against them. And they want stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI thought of O\xe2\x80\x99 Reilly\xe2\x80\x99s whiny tone as I saw the out-of-work guys on my street, slapping hands and yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cObama!\xe2\x80\x9d They waved to me; I waved back and yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cObama!\xe2\x80\x9d None of us knew exactly what the other meant just that we felt a shared joy. But I also knew that in a few days they would be asking for money from whoever left the bodega. And they asked because, yes, they wanted things.\nI felt a sad rage each time I shook my head at their outstretched palms. It is tragic to see them want control over their lives without first taking control of their minds. I mean they just dreamed in commercials. They talked of fancy cars they\xe2\x80\x99d never drive, homes they\xe2\x80\x99d never live in, jewelry they\xe2\x80\x99d never wear.\nThey were taught to want the Good Life without being given a chance to create their own vision of it. Instead, the capitalism that O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly celebrates flashes in their minds even though it has less and less need of them. It closes factories in high-wage nations and re-opens them in low-wage ones. It forces swollen-eyed women to sew clothes for dimes each hour. It designs robots that work without sleep. Capitalism needs fewer workers with more skills to produce larger amounts of commodities. The store shelves are lined with things the out-of-work guys on my street can\xe2\x80\x99t afford.\nOur capitalism. It churns like a hurricane across national boundaries. It freezes nature under the sign of commodity. It forces hungry peasants into the city, where it sifts them for the lowest wage for the longest hours. It lifts up a bourgeoisie, who in turn hire the media to unleash a cascade of ideology that saturates the people. But if workers organize and demand higher wages, capitalism spirals up and away to another place with hungrier people. Left in its wake are men and women who sell their bodies, beg on street corners, who dream of what they can\xe2\x80\x99t have, who want things.\nClimbing up the stairs, I heard my neighbor replaying President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election-night speech. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said as I reached my door, \xe2\x80\x9cwho wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAPOCALYPSE NOW\xe2\x80\x9cThe politicians are fucking up,\xe2\x80\x9d a tall black woman shouted on the gas line, \xe2\x80\x9cIf they were on their shit we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here.\xe2\x80\x9d Around her, people gruffly agreed. As I drove the U-Haul van, I eyed their red containers, sloshing with gasoline. Against my will, I imagined black streams of carbon rising from my van\xe2\x80\x99s muffler, rising from the cars on the road, rising from the buildings on the street into the sky.\nBeyond the horizon, I imagined each city as a chimney of carbon spewing gas that thickened the sky like Jell-O. Under the greenhouse blanket, earth\xe2\x80\x99s white ice caps will vanish; land will disintegrate into desert and hurricanes slam cities. And the tall woman at the gas station will be back on this line fighting over food, gas and water as police guard the neighborhoods of the wealthy. Nature is now the battlefield for class struggle.\nBlinking the imagery away, I knew it was the apocalyptic vision of the future that reverberates across the left. And it was troubling. It hung over me like a pastor. So when I parked the van and saw my apartment light was left on, it was a \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d sin. Meat in my refrigerator? A sin. My plane ticket? Another sin. And the convenience is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to die to experience Hell. Just wait, earth will become one.\nAnd a whole industry has arisen that \xe2\x80\x94 like medieval penances \xe2\x80\x94 lets us work off guilt by buying eco-friendly commodities. \xe2\x80\x9cGreen\xe2\x80\x9d toilet paper, \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d dish soap, \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d grocery bags underneath my kitchen sink. The environmental language has even seeped into our romantic lives. Weeks ago, I caught myself saying to my lover that our relationship wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csustainable.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut the other is the apocalyptic vision that drives us with fear. For a few of us that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Driving past wrecked homes in Staten Island as Mom sighed heavily, I was afraid of climate change. When I see her life, ruined, its debris sprawled across my apartment, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s real. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough. The change is too slow and the First World will have time to recreate itself into a global gated community, until eventually, the waves breach those walls, too. By that time, it will be too late to stop the earth from dying.\nAnd here is the social contradiction, billions of people are unemployed. They want to be consumers but the very act of consumption drives a capitalist economy that kills the planet. And they won\xe2\x80\x99t stop. Consuming is not just about need, it\xe2\x80\x99s about desire. We buy new selves when we get new shoes, new clothes, new cars and new homes.\nI think back to when I felt new. It was always while creating art or protesting. The activists I know also want new selves but instead of buying them, they recreate their lives in the act of recreating the world. They march, sing, drum, block traffic, wrestle each other out of a cop\xe2\x80\x99s vice-like grip, get arrested and emerge from jail with a halo of heroism.\nAnd a speculative identity exists between the consumer and the activist, both recreate themselves but where the former buys experience, the latter creates it. And that will to create seemed to be a seed-vision that was more humane, more needed than apocalypse.\nLooking out the window, I imagined what it would look like if we could tax the wealthy and use their money to hire everyone on my block to green our homes. Would trees be planted on sidewalks? Would dust rise as construction crews laid down porous streets? Would the out-of-work-guys come back with hard hats after building a sea wall in Staten Island?\nIs it possible to connect our vision of tomorrow with people\xe2\x80\x99s hope rather than fear? My Mom yelled from the bedroom, \xe2\x80\x9cHey did you hear about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Red Hook?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Occupy group is giving supplies to people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cReminds me of what we did in the \xe2\x80\x9960s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n'",b'\n',"b'November 18, 2012'","b'In the overlapping wakes of Hurricane Sandy and the reelection of a President who boasts of adding \xe2\x80\x9cenough new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the earth,\xe2\x80\x9d a divestment campaign led by 350.org is under way across the country. The target: fossil fuel companies.\nThe day after the election, 350.org, led by long-time environmental writer Bill McKibben, kicked off a 22-city Do the Math divestment campaign. After having some provisional success in winning the denial of a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline earlier this year, McKibben and 350.org are pivoting from lobbying elected officials to calling on schools, churches and government pension funds to sell off fossil fuel stocks. 350.org is modeling its effort on the South Africa divestment campaign of the 1980s that helped bring an end to apartheid.\nThe campaign\xe2\x80\x99s start date of Nov. 7 was no accident.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that many people have put a lot of effort into reelecting Barack Obama. But we want to insist on the tremendous amount of work that continues to need to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie McChesney, a field organizer with 350.org.\nThe tour which continues into December, stopped in New York on Nov. 16.\nWhile it is unclear how much of a dent this divestment effort will make in the bottom lines of fossil fuel companies, 350.org\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is more focused on building a broad coalition of supporters that will pressure these companies over the long term.\nThe mood has been both high-spirited and intense, with a sold-out audience of 1,600 people attending the tour\xe2\x80\x99s debut in Seattle, Wa., on Nov. 7. Yet he remains solemn, reminding attendees that the way forward will be long and hard. His assessment of climate activism thus far: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere near.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe math at the centerpiece of the campaign demonstrates the urgent need to rapidly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide we produce. According to 350.org, almost every government in the world agrees that any global warming above 2 degrees Celsius would be catastrophic. However, fossil fuel corporations currently have five times more oil, coal and gas reserves \xe2\x80\x94 totaling 2,795 gigatons \xe2\x80\x94 than climate scientists think is safe to burn. Scientists estimate that only 565 more gigatons of fossil fuels can be burned before we lose any chance of avoiding warming that exceeds the 2 degrees Celsius mark.\nFor the fossil fuel industry to heed the scientists and leave these reserves underground, they would have to write off roughly $20 trillion in carbon assets.\nDuring the tour, McKibben will be joined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, author Naomi Klein and Gasland filmmaker John Fox, among other notable figures, to connect the dots.\nBut Do the Math is about more than just speeches.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tours are also about mobilizing people for further actions and movement-building,\xe2\x80\x9d said McChesney, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build a model that people can use and develop autonomously.

Instead, they advocated an all-out assault on untapped fossil fuel resources from upstate New York to the Arctic Sea (see page 10).\nIt has been convenient for politicians and the corporate media to fix the public\xe2\x80\x99s attention on small bands of scary Islamic extremists on the other side of the world.

The real threat lies in the fossil fuel industries that will, if unfettered, lock us permanently into a dirty-energy future that will fry the planet \xe2\x80\x94 and a capitalist system that rewards the short-term profiteering of the few at the expense of the many as well as of the natural world.\nIf \xe2\x80\x9cgreen capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d is possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s see it soon.

Otherwise, we can expect planetary ecosystems to unravel further as we descend into a world in which desperate battles are fought over dwindling resources amid widespread social disintegration.\nSystem change or climate change?

It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising, because she basically gets the fight for workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights (even if her boss doesn\xe2\x80\x99t). Remember the huge standoff in Wisconsin over anti-union governor Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s attack on public workers in 2011? As janitors and firemen occupied the state house, the New York Times reported, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen West Wing officials discovered that the Democratic National Committee had mobilized Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s national network to support the protests, they angrily reined in the staff at the party headquarters. Administration officials said they saw such events beyond Washington as distractions from the optimistic \xe2\x80\x98win the future\xe2\x80\x99 message Mr. Obama introduced with his State of the Union Address.\xe2\x80\x9d Solis\xe2\x80\x99s reputation of fighting for worker\xe2\x80\x99s rights gained nothing from an administration that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lift a finger for the pro-worker Employee Free Choice Act while unions, public and private sector, shrink and grow weaker.\nSecretary of EnergySteven Chu (2009 \xe2\x80\x94 present)\nNobel Prize winner Chu has the respect of the scientific community and occasionally calls it as he sees it (saying in 2007, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cCoal is my worst nightmare\xe2\x80\x9d), but his lackluster leadership has promoted the misnomer \xe2\x80\x9cclean coal,\xe2\x80\x9d pushed nuclear power (even after Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Fukushima disaster), wanly supported the controversial XL Tar Sands Pipeline, and been simply missing in action on global climate change. If he continues this way, Chu\xe2\x80\x99s place in the history books will be as the one administration official who was smart enough to realize the dangers of global climate change, but did virtually nothing to mitigate the coming storm.\nSecretary of the TreasuryTimothy Geithner (2009 \xe2\x80\x93 present)\nTimothy Geither is so in lockstep with Wall Street that everyone is under the mistaken belief that he\xe2\x80\x99s directly from Goldman Sachs (which tends to happen when you negotiate a secret $30 billion loan for an investment firm with negligible interest). From World Trade Organizations negotiations under Clinton in the 1990s to saving Wall Street after it cratered the economy, Geithner has protected banking interests under Democrats for decades now.

I propose the following new mission for the agency:\nDEA = Dare to Explore Alternatives\nI think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say our drug enforcement policies fit the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result.\nMy goal as DEA administrator is to break the cycle of agency dependency on supply-side approaches emphasizing interdiction, arrest, conviction and incarceration as the principal way to win the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d I recommend the DEA explore alternative drug policies and practices in the following three areas:\nReform Marijuana Policy\nA. Reschedule Marijuana and Allow State Experimentation\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time the DEA acknowledged the shift in public opinion regarding the appropriateness of punishing people for possessing and using marijuana \xe2\x80\x94 16 states and the District of Columbia have approved access to marijuana for medical use. Last November voters in Washington and Colorado approved initiatives authorizing their states to tax and regulate marijuana cultivation and distribution to adults for recreational use. Recent polls have affirmed this is not just a regional shift \xe2\x80\x94 nationally, more than 50 percent of Americans 40 years and younger believe marijuana should be legally regulated for adult use, more than two thirds of Americans of all ages support access to medical marijuana. Yet federal policy still considers marijuana a dangerous drug, deserving of Schedule 1 status, meaning it has no legitimate use \xe2\x80\x94 more dangerous than cocaine, which is classified Schedule 2. The policy defies logic and experience, which is why almost one-third of states have enacted laws directly in defiance. What should a transformational administration do?\nDare to explore alternatives!\nI recommend the DEA support the request by the governors of Washington, Rhode Island and Vermont that the federal government reschedule marijuana consistent with available science and medical research.\nPresident Obama recently affirmed that pursuing marijuana users is not a priority of federal law enforcement; as he correctly noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have bigger fish to fry.\xe2\x80\x9d It makes sense for the DEA and Justice Department to allow officials to develop and implement effective regulatory schemes in states that have approved access to marijuana. A recent economic study projects the development of a legal supply of domestically grown cannabis in the United States has the potential to dramatically reduce the profits derived by Mexican drug cartels \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, the Sinaloa cartel could lose about $1 billion/year if it had to compete with marijuana grown in Washington or Colorado. Few U.S. drug policies have significantly affected the profitability of the illicit drug trade; the DEA should encourage states to be \xe2\x80\x9claboratories for experimentation\xe2\x80\x9d by exploring alternative drug policies that can undermine the power and profits of drug trafficking organizations is something the DEA should endorse.\nB. Reduce Marijuana Arrests\nNationally, arrests for marijuana offenses account for nearly half of all drug arrests by state and local law enforcement, often made possible by federal funding. African-American and Latino youth are disproportionately targeted for drug law enforcement, and marijuana arrests are no exception. This racially biased law enforcement undermines the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal of increasing high school retention rates and improving educational outcomes, particularly for black and Latino youth. Under my direction, the DEA will make receipt of federal funding for local law enforcement contingent on demonstrating elimination of racial, gender and ethnic and age disparities in drug law enforcement as well as reducing arrests for marijuana offenses.\nReduce Prescription Drug Abuse\nWhile the DEA has focused primarily on fighting illicit drug use, prescription drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions. In recent years more people have died from prescription drug overdoses than all the illicit drugs combined. For millions of Americans with inadequate or no health insurance, pharmaceuticals are marketed as a relatively cheap way to deal with various health challenges. Painkillers and medications that treat attention deficit disorders have become common drugs of abuse. So far the DEA has relied on strategies designed to reduce diversion, but an unintended consequence of this approach has been shortages of medication for legitimate patients with immediate needs.\nThe DEA will initiate a public education campaign about the dangers of prescription drug abuse \xe2\x80\x94 Pills Can Kill. The campaign will target populations with heightened vulnerability to prescription drug abuse including students, shift workers, military veterans and people with mental health disorders. I recommend the DEA collect data from states with medical marijuana programs to assess the efficacy of cannabis for pain management. Evidence suggests marijuana may provide a viable alternative to oxycodone and other pharmaceutical opioids for managing acute and/or chronic pain.\nMitigate the international impact of U.S. drug law enforcement\nNowhere have the consequences of drug war militarization been felt more acutely than in Mexico. Over the past six years, more than 60,000 men, women and children have lost their lives in Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s bloody drug war as cartels battle the government and each other for access to the lucrative U.S. drug market. Often they\xe2\x80\x99re killing each other with guns that come from the United States, purchased with money laundered by U.S. banks.\nOur neighbors to the south have become disillusioned with the war on drugs. Recently leaders from Mexico, Honduras, Belize, Costa Rica and Guatemala have called for reassessing the global drug prohibition regime that relies on punishment and exploring alternative approaches that will reduce the violence, sickness and death associated with the drug war. The DEA will endorse the call by Latin American leaders for a regional meeting of the Organizatio of American States to discuss drug policies followed by a U.N. General Assembly Special Session on drug prohibition no later than 2015. Together we will Dare to Explore Alternatives to punitive drug prohibition.\nDeborah Peterson Small is the executive director of Break the Chains, a public policy research and advocacy organization committed to addressing the disproportionate impact of punitive drug policies on poor communities of color.\n'",b'\n',"b'January 21, 2013'","b'\n\tEric Laursen\n\tSecretary\n\tDepartment of Health and Human Services\nIf ever there was a part of the Washington bureaucracy that has nowhere to go but up, it would be the Department of Health and Human Services. Last year, HHS was the centerpiece of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to show that it could be just as big a budget-cutter as any Republican White House, not for a moment sparing the most vulnerable. In some ways, it succeeded.\nHHS administers a host of programs that aren\xe2\x80\x99t well known to most Americans but that are vital to poor households. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 austerity budget called for cutting the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, reducing immunization programs for the low-income and uninsured, slashing graduate education funding for children\xe2\x80\x99s doctors and eliminating of the Preventive Health and Health Service Block Grant. The latter is an especially valuable way to shift the focus of U.S. healthcare toward prevention and wellness\xe2\x80\x94something that\xe2\x80\x99s just considered rational in most industrialized countries.\nAll of these are cuts that Americans will find themselves paying for sooner or later in the form of privation and worse health care for the poorest. In addition, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be dealing with the consequences of continuing woeful underfunding of vital services like foster care and other child care, HIV/AIDS prevention programs and home-based care for seniors.\nSo where do I go from here, as secretary of HHS? First, a word of definition. Outside of Homeland Security, HHS is the biggest mishmash of programs and services in the federal government. Another way to think of it is Medicare, Medicaid and everything else. Medicare makes up 56 percent of HHS\xe2\x80\x99s budget, Medicaid 30 percent, and everything else \xe2\x80\x94 from Indian Health Services to HIV/AIDS \xe2\x80\x94 8 percent. It\xe2\x80\x99s that last 8 percent that always takes the brunt of the budget cuts.\nAs secretary, I\xe2\x80\x99ll push aggressively to allow State Innovation Waivers for ObamaCare by 2014, rather than 2017, so that Vermont and other states that choose to follow its lead can move ahead with single-payer alternatives to the \xe2\x80\x9cmarket-based\xe2\x80\x9d solutions embodied in the president\xe2\x80\x99s healthcare law. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the people to make clear the long-term cost of the program cuts that the administration pushed for HHS in 2012. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll fight Republican efforts to turn Medicaid into a block-grant program that state governments can then manipulate away from its focus on helping the poor and working poor.\nHHS is probably the most vilified set of programs in government, used over and over by conservatives looking for cheap ways to assert that poverty programs breed poverty or that government is trying to use these programs to create a society of welfare dependency. Most HHS secretaries in recent decades have just tried to keep their heads down and avoid controversy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a different route. I\xe2\x80\x99ll expose Republican efforts to censor scientific research at the Centers for Disease Control, to keep contraception unavailable, to exempt certain states from the universal coverage requirements of ObamaCare and to keep end-of-life planning from being covered as part of Medicare. Among many other things.\nThis might seem less than overwhelming \xe2\x80\x94 good policy, but nothing more. But the conservative culture war on social services doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually take the form of out-and-out assaults on big, universal programs like Medicare. Instead, it consists of attacks on parts of these programs, and on more modest programs, usually in the name of religious freedom or family values. Often these are inaccurate, such as Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign-trail accusation that Obama wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cgut\xe2\x80\x9d work requirements for federal welfare programs. But the point is to deny the validity of any solution to social problems that can be described as collective or cooperative \xe2\x80\x94 even when it\xe2\x80\x99s run by government and even when the private sector makes a profit from it, as with Medicare and much of ObamaCare.\nThe first duty of the secretary of HHS has got to be to publicly, aggressively fight back against these attacks, making clear that the work of HHS is vital to maintaining a civilized society and throw the conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 real agenda back in their faces \xe2\x80\x94 to cut anything and everything that poses any threat to the low-tax, low-wage economic regime they\xe2\x80\x99ve built for themselves. Should the President prefer that I avoid controversy and leave this fundamental issue alone, my course is clear\xe2\x80\x94I will resign.\nEric Laursen is an independent journalist based in western Massachusetts.

Because ultimately, though good legislation and good executive branch work helps, really, what will revitalize labor is the workers taking the struggle into their own hands.\nThat said, here\xe2\x80\x99s a few ideas that I\xe2\x80\x99d push for, in addition to deeper, better, stronger and fiercer enforcement of laws holding bosses accountable for how they treat their workforce. It\xe2\x80\x99s so far beyond time to raise the minimum wage that it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, and a good secretary of labor would lead that fight \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99d say to about $15 an hour and index it to inflation so we\xe2\x80\x99re never stuck in this place again.

Like most of our social safety net, it\xe2\x80\x99s tied to one\xe2\x80\x99s (former) job in a way that leaves too many people vulnerable. With unemployment still high and jobs still too scarce, it\xe2\x80\x99s past time to start talking about an idea from the Nixon administration \xe2\x80\x94 a guaranteed minimum income/universal basic income.

Currently, there are more abandoned properties in this country than there are homeless people, and the solution is obvious: combine the two. Dr. Jill Stein and I ran on a platform of the Green New Deal, which is based on the principle that all Americans have a right to safe, decent and accessible affordable housing. I will work to further this goal.\nCurrent HUD programs are grossly inadequate and have massive undesirable consequences. A salient example is the failed HOPE VI program. This program, begun in 1993, was designed to revitalize and remedy problems with public housing by departing from the former \xe2\x80\x9chousing project\xe2\x80\x9d model and moving toward mixed-use development. While a laudable goal, the program has failed and has only made the housing crisis for America\xe2\x80\x99s poor worse. Grants are being used to demolish existing public housing in order to rebuild new \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-use\xe2\x80\x9d units. There is, however, no requirement that the new construction have a \xe2\x80\x9cone-to-one\xe2\x80\x9d replacement of the former housing units. Additionally, \xe2\x80\x9cmixed use\xe2\x80\x9d has been used to develop mixed-income housing, which shrinks the number of units available to the poor and amounts to nothing less than the usurpation of housing from the poor to be given at subsidized rates to the middle class.\nThe result of this failed program, in cities from Louisville, Ky., and Columbus, Ohio, to the Bay Area in California, is the displacement of U.S. families who can least afford such a change. Families are being uprooted from communities they have lived in for generations and shipped to remote communities without access to transit or employment centers and in many cases left homeless. Rather than solving problems with low-income housing, the HOPE VI program merely hides the poor from the view.\nI will immediately institute a moratorium on the disbursement of any further HOPE VI monies. The requirements for obtaining such a grant must be amended. In the first instance, the demolition of housing should be a last resort. Many units have been family homes for generations, and the immoral destruction of these homes must end. In those instances where rebuilding is the best option, the program must require a one-to-one replacement of any demolished unit. Furthermore, these new units must be reserved for low-income families who depend on public housing. Finally, the siting of additional or new units must be in urban centers with access to transit and jobs and not in undesirable and remote areas that burden residents with crippling commutes.\nAs my first order of business, I will END homelessness by housing our veterans, our seniors and our low-income families. We will empty the shelters and fill the homes!\nThe recommendations above are but the beginning: With the Green New Deal we could make all of this and more a reality.

This would include vigilance and perseverance in enforcing the existing regulations to limit contaminants in the air, water or soil.\nBut there is a much bigger challenge before us. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing less than an energy transformation, bringing down the carbon-based sources that spell climate doom and replacing them with solar\xe2\x80\x93based renewables. A vitalized EPA can play a major role in the transition, which, not incidentally, can go a long way toward restoring our economy. Capitalists create unemployment and also use the threat of further unemployment to prevent the mending of ecological damage by saying that this would take away jobs. Somehow it is forgotten that an energy transformation to a solar-based economy requires a whole lot of work \xe2\x80\x94 and that the jobs to carry this out can be funded through the taking down of the old, carbon-based economy. The government has a role to play here, but only if it stands on the side of the people and the earth. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a brief outline of the strategy:\nClamp down on the \xe2\x80\x9cfour horsemen\xe2\x80\x9d of the climate change apocalypse: offshore petroleum extraction, especially in deeper waters; mountaintop removal coal mining; hydrofracking for natural gas; and tar sands extraction and transport by Keystone XL, from Alberta to Texas now, and wherever else these processes will occur. The EPA has plenty of tools to put the kibosh on these murderous technologies. All it takes is some principled action. There are lots of activists who would help out.\nBegin moving to the carbon tax that many countries around the world are initiating. The EPA has a shot at being able to initiate this. Combine it with elimination of the worthless \xe2\x80\x9ccap-and-trade\xe2\x80\x9d system that has served to mystify the possibilities of enlightened state action. A tax of $20/ton of carbon could raise $125 billion.\nSet aside a portion of this to protect poor and working people from the higher prices of carbon fuels.\nCombine the rest with $100 billion raised through cuts in the military \xe2\x80\x94 the most wasteful and toxic part of society. Now we have a nice sum with which to do something worthwhile.\nUse the funds to create a national program, substantially planned and administered locally, to transition to an energy grid of solar and wind power.\nObama might stand in the way. But (like FDR) hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he urged us to present him with powerful movements that would compel him to act?\n\xc2\xa0\nThere will be a lot of details to work out. It will be exciting and, for a big change, hopeful. It could even lead to a revolution. And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what many of us have been asking for?\nJoel Kovel is author of The Enemy of Nature and a founder of Ecosocialist Horizons.\n'",b'\n',"b'January 21, 2013'","b'\n\tBill McKibben\n\tSecretary\n\tDepartment of Energy\nNow that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been named secretary of energy, let me tell you my first order of business: no more kowtowing to the fossil fuel industry. We\xe2\x80\x99re done being the enablers of the coal and gas and oil industry, and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to tell the truth to the American people about the damage they\xe2\x80\x99re doing to communities, to landscapes, and most of all to the climate.\nIf I can get one thing done before I\xe2\x80\x99m fired, it will be to help stoke opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. I know I serve at the President\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, but I serve at my pleasure too, and I simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be part of an administration that will approve a project opposed by all the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top climate scientists, a project that will help open up a vast new source of carbon, a project that will pour yet more money into the pockets of the Koch brothers.\nOnce the President has blocked Keystone, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have real credibility with the broad environmental movement, which is good, because there\xe2\x80\x99s an awful lot that we need to get done together. Powerful new EPA regulations to protect communities \xe2\x80\x94 especially poor communities \xe2\x80\x94 from the effects of soot and ozone and the asthma that comes with burning coal. A serious fee-and-dividend system that makes it clear we own the sky, not Exxon \xe2\x80\x94 and that finally puts a real price on carbon. A feed-in tariff system modeled on Germany\xe2\x80\x99s, which has installed so much renewable energy that some days last summer half the country\xe2\x80\x99s power came from solar panels. An end to research on oxymorons like \xe2\x80\x9cclean coal\xe2\x80\x9d and a massive increase in money for truly transformative research and development.\nAnd as we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with our own troubles, we also have to get back into the international conversation.

We therefore reform the existing Federal Elections Commission into a new Federal Democracy Commission, whose mandate is fourfold:\n\n\t\tConvening of constitutional conventions at least once every 30 years so as to ensure that the basic law of these United States is the law of the living, not the dead. Currently, such a convention may be initiated at the request of the States. Until the Constitution may be amended so as to make constitutional reform a more regular practice, the role of the Federal Democracy Commission in the convening of constitutional conventions shall be to encourage and make transparent the existing amendment process.\n\n\t\tThe implementation and enforcement of the Voter Bill of Rights, as enacted by Congress, as well as existing voting rights and election law.

I found Secretary Napolitano\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to be exemplary as applied to the terms defining her position as DHS secretary. These terms, framed 11 days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, provide a foundation for what it means to direct our Department of Homeland Security. However, I regretfully, and respectfully, submit to you today, that these terms upon which we apply the responsibility of securing of our homeland are flawed. I intend to spend my term as secretary redefining these terms, and eventually redefining the position of secretary to the Department of Homeland Security.\nWith no disrespect intended to Secretary Napolitano, I will share with you a conversation she and I had regarding these aforementioned terms.\nWhen I asked Secretary Napolitano to recall her first days in office, she waxed nostalgic about a conversation she had in 2009 with her predecessor, Secretary Michael Chertoff, about \xe2\x80\x9cthe cornerstone of our security apparatus.\xe2\x80\x9d This \xe2\x80\x9ccornerstone\xe2\x80\x9d was handed down from Tom Ridge to Chertoff to Napolitano. When I asked her what this \xe2\x80\x9ccornerstone\xe2\x80\x9d was she simply replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemization of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOver the past nine-and-a-half years, this department has grown exponentially to employ more than 240,000 Americans around a principle that in order to innoculate our population against an attack by an invisible enemy we must first \xe2\x80\x9cenemize\xe2\x80\x9d everything, treating each and every living thing (and at times even non-living electronic entities) as if she, he, they or it were plotting the next attack on our homeland. The private sector has also seen unfettered growth around its ability to monetize \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemization of everything,\xe2\x80\x9d from developing security technologies in response to unforeseen \xe2\x80\x9cenemies\xe2\x80\x9d to using the specter of terrorism to draft and fast-track model legislation that serves business interests.\nWhile taking a position that everything is an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy\xe2\x80\x9d can make it harder for an \xe2\x80\x9cenemy\xe2\x80\x9d to execute his or her plans, it also creates an ugly, fear-driven environment that sows seeds of distrust, from misplaced suspicions about your neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s religious or political affiliations to fears of crowds or airplanes. Moreover, this \xe2\x80\x9cenemization of everything\xe2\x80\x9d has been observed to have a profound psychological impact on some individuals. For some, being told over and over by peers or media that they are \xe2\x80\x9can enemy\xe2\x80\x9d makes them want to react by becoming that enemy. After surviving a decade rife with violent outbursts and mass shootings, we as a nation cannot afford to ignore the psychological impacts of our post-9/11 terror culture and security-industrial complex on the moral fabric of our communities.\nI intend to use my directorship here at the Department of Homeland Security to transform this agency into a restorative agency. To do so we must first undo this prerequisite \xe2\x80\x9cenemization\xe2\x80\x9d model. We then need to reach an understanding that terrorism, whether political or apolitical like a shooting in a movie theater, almost always has an origin. These origins should be treated as wounds that we as an agency have a responsibility to heal. If we as an agency can isolate these origins on various cultural, systematic or personal levels, we can begin to heal the wounds that jeopardize our security.\nFrom deeply personal individual battles with cancer to the global war on terror, human responses to these acute onslaughts are almost always reactionary and seldom preventative.\nAmid the immediacy of our tragedies we rarely question what brought us to those malignant moments; instead we desperately reach for quick fixes \xe2\x80\x94 surgery, chemotherapy, torture, drones, carpet-bombing. In the global war on terror, preventative medicine is often practiced as pre-emptive military action, rendition, entrapment, torture and sanctions. These means never challenge the cultural roots of the problem and often serve as a tool for terrorist recruitment.\nLike flourishing bacterial cultures in a petri dish, terrorism is a symptomatic cultural reflex that can be easily seen growing out of its own hospitable environments. Oppression, poverty, inadequate education, constant subjugation to the accepted institutionalized abuse of animals and a lack of individual autonomy are the stagnant waters in which this global disease of terrorism takes root and grows. As secretary, I intend to use this agency to analyze, isolate and ultimately treat the prerequisite events that give way to future acts of violence.\nTo make this agency a restorative agency, not only must we speak in a restorative manner, but our actions and our policies must also promote restoration.\nMany of my detractors have speculated about my proposed policy changes, some have gone as far as to call them \xe2\x80\x9ctreasonous.\xe2\x80\x9d I will reserve any comments regarding my policy plans for a later date, but can assure those detractors that I fully intend to re-write their script of \xe2\x80\x9cenemization\xe2\x80\x9d to an American story of empathy and healing.\nSincerely,\nAndy Stepanian\n\tSecretary\n\tDepartment of Homeland Security\nAndy Stepanian is the co-founder of SparrowMedia.net and a SHAC 7 defendant who served three years in federal prison on terrorism-related charges.\n'",b'\n',"b'January 21, 2013'","b'\n\tNancy Goldstein\n\tDirector\n\tOffice of Public Engagement\nMy first act as Obama\xe2\x80\x99s new head of the Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs would be to heed the drum that a vast array of LGBT and human rights activists pounded all last year and put some damned LGBT non-discrimination policies in place, as Obama has failed to do despite his 2008 campaign promises. (Yes, DADT is certainly a fine beginning, but it took him until the third year of his first term to get on it, activists had to push him uphill the entire way, and it still allows discrimination against transgender servicemembers.)\nThe President could start by signing the executive order he refused to sign last April \xe2\x80\x94 the one that would ban federal contractors from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Of course, his inaction ticked off activists like Heather Cronk, managing director of GetEQUAL, who calls it \xe2\x80\x9cshameful that the United States government still chooses to accept the premise that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to fire someone simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.\xe2\x80\x9d But preventing taxpayer-funded workplace discrimination is such a no-brainer that even the New York Times Editorial page was peeved by the president\xe2\x80\x99s punting.\nAs political strategist Paul Yandura and blogger Joe Sudbay noted in a recent post, \xe2\x80\x9cThis executive order has been awaiting his signature for over two years now. He could do it this week, and it would be a historic first step toward federal employment protections.\xe2\x80\x9d It would also, according to Tico Almeida, President of the LGBT organization Freedom to Work, \xe2\x80\x9cgive the U.S. Labor Department strong enforcement powers to seek back wages and reinstatement for LGBT workers who are fired for discriminatory reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJust as important are the ways that the executive order would, as Yandura told me, provide \xe2\x80\x9cthe smartest step and best pathway we have toward passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\xe2\x80\x9d ENDA would offer the broadest possible protections for transgender and nonconforming people and has been languishing in Congress since 1994. As of now, only 16 states and the District of Columbia have statutes that protect against both sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in employment in the public and private sector. And, as Almeida pointed out, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99The order will also trigger national news stories pointing out congressional inaction on this issue, and that will help our movement with one of our biggest ENDA hurdles \xe2\x80\x94 the fact that 90 percent of Americans mistakenly believe ENDA has already become law.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nYandura also noted that the existing executive orders that protect minorities but exclude LGBT Americans, originated years before Congress got it together to pass federal legislation and were the impetus for that change. These orders create a strong foundation for legislation later passed by Congress. According to Nan Hunter, a lesbian law professor at Georgetown University, \xe2\x80\x9cHistory has shown executive orders for non discrimination often precede changes in law.\xe2\x80\x9d So there is a strong historic precedent for signing a similar order to protect LGBT Americans to create a pathway to passage of ENDA. Moreover, if the President signs a revised executive order now, almost a quarter of the U.S. workforce will have already lived under similar LGBT employment protections by the time ENDA does finally come up for a vote. That should go a long way toward undercutting any fear-based arguments used against it by homophobic and transphobic lawmakers.\nSo good morning, Mr. President, and welcome to your second term.

None of the bullets struck an artery or a bone. Someone was looking out for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThoughts spun like a tornado. Just a minute ago, I was jogging down the street to catch the presidential debate at Vodou Lounge when my name was yelled. In a parked jeep, a light came on and I saw Frankie, my scruffy neighbor. He told me of being on the stoop when a boy ran up, firing his gun at any moving thing, how bullets punched his body, how he prayed for life as blood gushed from his limbs.\nFrankie rolled up his pant leg and showed me a crusted hole in his calf. I grasped his hands and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so thankful you are alive.\xe2\x80\x9d We knew people had been shot on our block but in order to go about living, we numbed our minds to the risks. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard. The young men killing each other were locked in their own world \xe2\x80\x94 you just had to step around it. But every once in a while, a gunman shot so wildly, so carelessly that a shell pierced the invisible walls between us and them. Studying Frankie\xe2\x80\x99s face, I remembered kicking a soccer ball with him and loosening the fire hydrant so kids could splash in the water. We stared at each other as I repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so thankful you are alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTHE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF INNOCENCE\nLast Dec. 14, Adam Llaza stormed an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. and shot 20 children and six adults. Screams echoed in the hallways and throughout the nation as news of the killings rippled through the media. We have another mass shooting, another gunman.\nBut on the day before the killings in Newtown, as well as every day for the foreseeable future, nearly 85 Americans die from gun-related incidents. Of those 85 people, 53 take their own lives and 16 are homicide victims, between the ages of 15 and 24. In 2010, the annual number of Americans killed by guns hit 31,328. The rising numbers are like a heart monitor gone awry \xe2\x80\x94 the quotidian carnage is signified by a dark, steady pulse, while mass shootings are the visible spikes. This patient is sick, but we aren\xe2\x80\x99t listening to the true diagnosis.\nThese mass shooting escapades break through the fog of American denial because they are performed acts of violence, designed by the killer for an audience. Sometimes the gunman (and it\xe2\x80\x99s always, so far, a man) makes videos or writes a manifesto, as in the Virginia Tech massacre or Columbine. At the very least, murdering random people in public turns the blood-soaked ground into a stage for the killer to be seen. And it trains the audience to read gun violence along two scales \xe2\x80\x94 carnage and innocence.\nThe bodies carried out on stretchers stop our breath. A killer who leaves numerous dead in his wake forces us to sense the purity of his rage. He forces us to question the technology used to enact it. The carnage of mass shooting is a glimpse into how vulnerable we are to the random hate of a stranger.\nAnd if the faces on the stretchers are budding youth or the vulnerable old, if their deaths stained red a white wedding or emptied a prom night, we feel that not just life was lost \xe2\x80\x94 innocence itself was desecrated. Public mourning is not just empathy but also a ritual to reaffirm our ideology. The mass shootings in the Aurora cinema and then at the Sikh Temple in suburban Milwaukee rattled us, but it was the murder of children that made it possible to finally talk about gun control. Now we are unwilling to tolerate public gun violence after accepting it for so long in marginal groups \xe2\x80\x94 the poor, Latinos, African-Americans, new immigrants, urban youth.\nA political economy of innocence exists in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s media, in which the value of groups is produced, distributed and consumed. The race, class and gender of the victims are raw material added to the specific crime and made into an implicit scale of human worth. CNN, the New York Times and Fox News showed photos of the Newtown dead, creating empathic narratives. Millions of Americans mourned with the parents who lost their children, as we must, as befits a decent human being. But beneath tragedies like Newtown are the 85 people who die every day from a bullet. Many of the victims are urban youth, mostly black or Latino, whose deaths seep under the headlines like an invisible river of sorrow.\nTHE SETTLER VS. THE SAVAGE\n\xe2\x80\x9cImagine your child screaming when a convicted felon breaks into your home,\xe2\x80\x9d the gravelly voice warns as a parent sprints through halls. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you use a firearm to defend yourself and your family,\xe2\x80\x9d he growls. \xe2\x80\x9cUnbelievably, Barack Obama voted to make you the criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a National Rifle Association (NRA) political ad, released in October 2008.\nAfter the confetti from election night was swept up, news outlets reported that two things happened for male Republican voters \xe2\x80\x94 testosterone dropped and gun sales went up. A shudder rippled through conservative America, it was the fear of a crime, fear of loss of gun rights, fear of a race war. And this fear is more than 500 years old.\nWhen Christopher Columbus waded to the shoreline of the New World, he was met by native people of whom later he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI could conquer them with 50 men and govern as I please.\xe2\x80\x9d Thousands of ships filled with settlers followed in his wake. They pushed further inland, raping, mass murdering, stealing, displacing, and each act of violence solidified their role as settlers who killed savages. In the haze of musket smoke, the silhouettes of men marched over the blood of natives.\nAfter independence, our nation began a grinding conquest of the continent. At each step the gun was at hand. Whether it was the pistol in the belt of the slave owner or the settler\xe2\x80\x99s rifle aimed at a native family leaving a home in flames, the gun was the symbol of a freedom won by violence. In the painting Westward Angel we see Manifest Destiny portrayed as an angel. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine her hem passing over the corpses of indigenous people.\nIt is the violence between the settler and the savage that has formed the political ideology of our nation. The white, Christian male and his family founded a nation in the wilderness, away from the corruption of the Old World. The price of freedom was eternal vigilance at the walls. Outside the gates the ape- like slaves, wild savages and foreigners were amassing. The gun had to be near, loaded and ready.\nIt is this politico-mythic narrative that guides conservatives. Each time white supremacy has been challenged, a call to arms has been issued. After the Civil War, a brief season of civil liberties for black people followed, which was then shot down by white militias like the Ku Klux Klan. In the early 1900s nearly two million black people left the South in a Great Migration and were met by white mobs shooting, lynching and bombing them in the urban North. In the civil rights era, white gunmen killed activists. After World War II, cities became racially diverse just as the business class began to shut down factories in the name of globalization. Urban neighborhoods became poor and desperate; by the 1970s, the Republican Party used code words of crime and welfare to address white racial anxiety. Suburbs grew like pale rings of fear from the dark downtown. It is in this context that the Second Amendment, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to bear arms,\xe2\x80\x9d became a justification to defend oneself against the specter of crime, a specter that itself was already a fictionalized racial terror.\nToday the conservative sector of the shrinking white majority is terrified, stranded as they are in the colonial mythology of settler versus savage. They saw a rising tide of color elect the first black president and see Obama as part of a New World Order. It is believed to be a U.N.-led global cabal intent on using gun registries, background checks and bans on assault weapons to strip these Sovereign Citizens of the ability to fight and then, in turn, to enslave them.\nDuring a recent senate hearing, Democrat Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said to NRA spokesman Wayne Lapierre, \xe2\x80\x9cI run into some of your NRA members and they say\xe2\x80\xa6we need the firepower and the ability to protect ourselves from our government.\xe2\x80\x9d Lapierre leaned back, then leaned in, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at why our Founding Fathers put it there, they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure these free people, in this new country would never have to be subjugated again.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTHE BLACKENED BODY\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from Bed-Stuy where niggaz either do or they gone die, gotta keep the Ratchett close by,\xe2\x80\x9d Lil\xe2\x80\x99 Kim rapped from the car speakers. I laughed at the lyrics as my friend reached over and turned it up. After being dropped off in Bed-Stuy, I got out and looked at my street with Lil\xe2\x80\x99 Kim\xe2\x80\x99s voice in my head. It struck me that she, like many rappers, sells urban violence to America which then learns to see people of color in pain as normal.\nAn iconography of crime surrounds the blackened body, if one could peel the Hip Hop imagery of today \xe2\x80\x94 the Gangster, Video Vixen and Hype Man \xe2\x80\x94 you can see earlier versions of them in post-Civil War imagery of the Brute, the Jezebel and the Coon. It\xe2\x80\x99s the visual vocabulary of the political economy of guilt, in which imagery of black criminality is produced, distributed and consumed.\nThe caricature most related to crime is of course the Black Brute, a hulking rapist, an enraged animal on the loose. After the Civil War, in the era of Reconstruction, new images of blacks were created by Southern whites to express their fear. And the Black Brute was the epitome of the savage. It is what George Zimmerman, a watchman for a gated community in central Florida, saw instead of Trayvon Martin, a black teen visiting his family and it is what Zimmerman aimed his gun at when he shot the young man dead.\nZimmerman had a settler mindset and a firearm, and he was shielded by a legal tradition called the Castle Doctrine, which posits that you can defend your home with deadly force. \xe2\x80\x9cStand your ground\xe2\x80\x9d laws extend \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d to wherever one is legally allowed to stand. It was part of a network of legislation, including immunity for gun manufactures that was pushed by the NRA into law. Not surprisingly, the gun industry, which made $11 billion dollars in profit in 2011, donated at least $15 million dollars to the NRA since 2005. The bare facts are that the industry that profits from gun sales, in part funds a four million member-strong NRA which spends millions in elections on politicians who will pass laws beneficial to the gun industry. And we already have in this nation nearly 300 million guns for 310 million citizens.\nIn 2011 alone, gun makers churned out six million new firearms. These guns hit the market and are spread out on gun show tables, where thousands fall through the shredded net of gun control laws into the black market which transports them into black neighborhoods. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said on The Daily Show, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a concealable handgun that is killing people. Assault weapons, I think should be banned. But they are responsible for less than 2 percent of shootings in this city. Ninety percent of the guns that we confiscate here come from other states. We say the iron pipeline up I-95, Southern states for the most part.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd I see those guns. One night I heard some neighbors fighting and then gunshots, I looked through the window and saw a man entering his building with a long pistol. Four years ago, I was at the block party when a kid with a gun fired into the air, scattering everyone behind trees and running into buildings.\nRecently I saw a documentary, Bullets in the Hood: A Bed-Stuy Story, in which then 19-year-old director Terrence Fisher interviewed his friends about guns. One hauled a shotgun from under his mattress and boasted of paralyzing a \xe2\x80\x9cdumb-ass\xe2\x80\x9d man. Another held a small gun in his palm and warned, \xe2\x80\x9cSee this .22, can\xe2\x80\x99t get no better than that.\xe2\x80\x9d He wiped it with an American flag bandana.\nFisher asked how they felt with the weapon; one friend said, \xe2\x80\x9cAny man with a gun in his hand feels bigger than the world. A gun will make a man do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d Later Fisher remembered, \xe2\x80\x9cMy homeboy Marley G had an incident in a club. Dude had bumped Marley G. who bumped another dude, who got offended and pulled out his gun and shot him in his chest twice.\xe2\x80\x9d In the stairwell, Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s friend said guns weren\xe2\x80\x99t good but you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get caught without one in a fight. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the hood you gotta have one to survive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and shrugged.\nThree months into filming, Fisher was walking to the roof with his friend Timothy Stansbury when Stansbury opened the door and was shot dead by a scared cop. The officer was never charged with a crime and the people swallowed their grief. At the film\xe2\x80\x99s end, Fisher looked into the camera and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 19 and I know eight people who\xe2\x80\x99ve been killed by guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFisher lives in the Louis Armstrong projects that ring my block. From my roof, I can see the roof where Stansbury was shot. His death, like the police killings of Sean Bell or Ramarley Graham, gave a halo of innocence to young men of color. Thousands marched in their names to salvage a guiltlessness that has long been denied. And we, the left, marched with them, because in our Rousseauian worldview the state \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, personified by a cop \xe2\x80\x94 was the enemy of the people. But the reality is that more black and Latino, poor and immigrant male youth are killed by each other than by cops.\nVIOLENCE AND FREEDOM\nEver since Frederick Douglass wrote of fighting the slave breaker Covey there has existed in black male culture a tradition of seeing violence as a means of freedom. In the Ante-Bellum era, slaves rebelled 250 separate times, in incidents that ranged from skirmishes to all-out guerilla warfare. From Nat Turner to the Deacons for Defense, from Malcolm X to the Black Panthers, gun violence has been part of the black political tradition. But the goal of this violence was always the defense of the larger community against white supremacist attacks.\nIn the late 1970s the Black left collapsed in a cross-fire of rivalry, FBI sabotage and a changing economy. The black He-Man changed from Huey Newtown to Superfly, factories shut down, cities went bankrupt, cocaine fell on the street like a winter snow, and prisons became warehouses for an unemployed generation. The police used new tactics to round up young men en masse. They were processed like raw material through a factory of courts and jails and emerged on the other side, bleak-eyed and desperate. Street culture, always one sector among others now dominated the value system of poor young men of color.\nThe code of the street \xe2\x80\x94 the touchy need for respect, ignitable pride, the struggle for status in a world of scarcity, homophobic and sexist machismo and violence as an answer to questions \xe2\x80\x94 became a common language. And with each fistfight, stabbing and shooting, urban youth become more and more segregated. Inner city schools are closed, metal detectors installed in the ones still open, teachers are scared away and their future evaporates. The only thing they have left that anyone wants is the soundtrack of their self-destruction. So a minor music called Hip Hop, which began in the 1970s as block party music in the South Bronx was by the mid-1980s slowly being transformed by corporate America into the minstrel show of Gangsta Rap. The Brute and the Jezebel are reinvented and sold to a new audience. Three decades later, black, Latino and increasingly immigrant youth are measuring their racial identity by 150-year-old, post-Civil War Southern caricatures.\nOppression when internalized by its victims for too long and too deeply eventually becomes their culture. So it struck me, on the night that Frankie told me about the shooting, that as I walked up Nostrand, I heard a group of young men around an open car rapping along with 50 Cent, \xe2\x80\x9cWe rolling, whip stolen, AK loaded, I\xe2\x80\x99m down to ride tonight. We smokin\xe2\x80\x99, straight locin\xe2\x80\x99, locked and loaded, somebody gon\xe2\x80\x99 die tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI thought to myself, with all the guns and rage and nihilism here, you just might. And I thought, we on the left don\xe2\x80\x99t address crime for what it is, a violent form of street-level capitalism. On the way to the bar, I kept seeing Frankie\xe2\x80\x99s bullet wounds in my mind like a giant photograph. My friend almost died. He almost died. I kept repeating it.\nAnd who was seeing the invisible victims of violence? Who was peering beneath the tragic headlines of mass shootings to see the cities being hollowed out by the multiplying voids of our dead teenagers? Who was willing to speak about their deaths? Finally, I entered the Vodou Lounge and everyone was staring at the TV as President Obama and Mitt Romney debated. In the cross-fire of their words was a white college student named Jeremy. The candidates tripped over each other to promise him a job. Obama said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMELTING GUNS INTO SOLAR PANELS\nThe bar was nearly empty; I sat with a beer watching the State of the Union address. Obama tensed his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than a thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe presidential election had come and gone, washing over us like a giant wave of noise. And I was relieved Obama won. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t share the view that a Romney victory would galvanize people into protesting. It was to me an admission of a lack of vision on the left, by those who see having a common enemy as the only thing that can move the masses. What about a common vision?\nI looked out the window and imagined a neighborhood with midnight basketball to absorb the energy of youth whose homes were falling apart. Or taxing Wall Street and creating whole new job sectors? So much of the violence in these streets is read as simple personal violence and not as the effect of the violence of capitalism. How can an economic system dominate the earth, make exchanging labor for money as the principal way to meet basic needs and then not be able to provide full global employment? It is the contradiction grinding in our world. We are surrounded by ads for a life we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford and are told that no other world is possible. When can we get a federal buyback program that lets people sell their guns, while shutting down the gun factories and melting the steel into solar panels?\nObama squinted his eyes and talked of a young woman named Hadiya Peddleton. \xe2\x80\x9cJust three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.\nHe called for sensible reforms like a universal background check, a ban on assault weapons and laws to reduce the number of bullets in ammo cartridges. Yes, I nodded, all very sensible. He demanded the House and Senate allow for a vote as Mr. and Mrs. Peddleton stood and applauded. \xe2\x80\x9cThey deserve a vote,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama lifted his voice in a rhythmic call. \xe2\x80\x9cThey deserve a vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYes, I thought, we do deserve a vote but we need a whole lot more.\n'",b'\n',"b'February 21, 2013'","b'The split screen during the State of the Union address was a nice touch. After all, what is more practical, more common sense \xe2\x80\x94 more bipartisan, perhaps \xe2\x80\x94 than charts? My favorite chart was the one illustrating wages versus corporate profits over time. Those two jagged lines \xe2\x80\x94 one shooting sky high over the last decade, the other plummeting steadily over the last forty years \xe2\x80\x94 are worth a thousand words, as the saying goes. Throughout the State of the Union, President Obama railed against the reality the chart revealed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs, but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged,\xe2\x80\x9d he boomed. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWrong, indeed. But on the issue of income inequality, the president\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric was right across the board \xe2\x80\x94 that is, until he actually began unfurling his Grand Plans. That\xe2\x80\x99s when his typical double-speak kicked in.\nHe promised to curtail corporate profits, but his vision for a new, \xe2\x80\x9chigh-tech\xe2\x80\x9d America seemed to entail turning everything from our highways to our public schools into corporate-owned, public-private partnerships.\nMissed that part of the speech? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look at his lofty language.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow at schools like P-TECH in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York public schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate\xe2\x80\x99s degree in computers or engineering. We need to give every American student opportunities like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing a new challenge, to redesign America\xe2\x80\x99s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math, the skills today\xe2\x80\x99s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn other words, let\xe2\x80\x99s stop teaching to the standardized test \xe2\x80\x94 let\xe2\x80\x99s teach straight to IBM\xe2\x80\x99s computer repair manual.\nObama\xe2\x80\x99s proposed public-private partnerships went far beyond public school classrooms. They also included the country\xe2\x80\x99s most essential infrastructure: roads, bridges, rails and even the energy grid.\nAs the president said, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk any CEO where they\xe2\x80\x99d rather locate and hire, a country with deteriorating roads and bridges or one with high-speed rail and Internet, high-tech schools, self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America \xe2\x80\x94 a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina \xe2\x80\x94 has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they\xe2\x80\x99ll bring even more jobs. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOkay, so now we\xe2\x80\x99re bribing the same corporations whose exploitative profits we\xe2\x80\x99ve pledged to better control by giving the U.S. a makeover. But he went further:\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, tonight, I propose a fix-it-first program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don\xe2\x80\x99t shoulder the whole burden, I\xe2\x80\x99m also proposing a partnership to rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nCouched as a way to save taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 money, the president actually dangled a considerable carrot in front of corporations: construction grants and partial ownership of nearly all of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 infrastructure.\nPublic-private partnerships are essentially a stepping stone to full privatization of our roads, bridges, railways, power grids and \xe2\x80\x94 yes \xe2\x80\x94 even our public schools.\nThe implications of this proposal are so scary that they even startled a Fox News reporter who commented, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unnerving to hear the suggestion that the best way to guard against corporate excess is by crafting ever-closer public-private partnerships.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a concept, public-private partnerships can be considered a metaphor for any type of privatization: they sound smart in a capitalist society, but they\xe2\x80\x99re never what they\xe2\x80\x99re cracked up to be.\nAs a trio of smart economics professors, including one at Yale University, wrote in a paper on using these partnerships to revamp U.S. infrastructure, \xe2\x80\x9cPublic-private partnerships are often touted as a \xe2\x80\x9cbest-of-both-worlds\xe2\x80\x9d alternative to public provision and privatization. But in practice, they have been dogged by contract design problems, waste, and unrealistic expectations. Governments sometimes opt for a public-private partnership, for example, because they mistakenly believe that it offers a way to finance infrastructure without adding to the public debt. In other cases, contract renegotiations have resulted in excessive costs for taxpayers or losses for private firms.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA 30-year study of public-private partnerships in the UK concludes that the experiment\xe2\x80\x99s track record has \xe2\x80\x9cled to an overhang of debt stretching some 30 years into the future and to constraints on the way public bodies are able to use their assets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOn the issue of wages, which President Obama paid so much lip service to during his address, one of the biggest problems with public-private partnerships is that the work will be contracted to private companies rather than performed by unionized, public workers \xe2\x80\x94 a reality that will deal another blow to the dwindling power of unions and the public sector.\nBut an even graver problem is that pursuing public-private partnerships mirrors the financial impulse that got us into this deficit and recession mess in the first place: choosing short-term gains over long-term policies.\nAs a leader of the Service Employees International Union testified in a Senate committee hearing in 2006, \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe governments that sign long-term concession agreements for essential infrastructure assets without retaining an ongoing interest in those assets [public-private partnerships] risk being perceived as the equivalent of the Native Americans who sold Manhattan Island to Peter Minuit for the equivalent of $24 in beads and trinkets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe historical analogy is striking, while somewhat insensitive to the fact that European colonists would have taken Manhattan even if the Native Americans had not signed the land over in exchange for beads. Then again, if the people of the United States do not soon demonstrate an actual commitment to controlling corporate power, then these multinational corporations will indeed become even more powerful, gutting the people\xe2\x80\x99s land and infrastructure and carrying the profits far away from U.S. soil into off-shore bank accounts.\nIn this light, public-private partnerships appear to be no more than the false treaties before the real battle. Surely those same treaties shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the president\xe2\x80\x99s domestic agenda.\nAn earlier version of this article appeared on Alternet.org.\n'",b'\n',"b'February 21, 2013'","b'On Jan. 10 the staff of Garfield High School voted unanimously to refuse to administer the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test to their ninth-grade students. They\xe2\x80\x99ve held firm since, even as the superintendent of schools has threatened them with a 10-day unpaid suspension. Meanwhile, teachers at other Seattle-area schools have joined their boycott.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGarfield has a long tradition of cultivating abstract thinking, lyrical innovation, trenchant debate, civic leadership, moral courage and myriad other qualities for which our society is desperate, yet which cannot be measured, or inspired by bubbling answer choice \xe2\x80\x98E,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Garfield history teacher Jesse Hagopian in a Seattle Times op-ed.\nGarfield\xe2\x80\x99s Parent-Teacher-Student Association and student government are both backing the teachers, and the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union, the Seattle Education Association (an affiliate of the National Education Association), has been holding phone banks and rallies in support. NEA president Dennis van Roeckel called the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 stand a \xe2\x80\x9cdefining moment within the education profession.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs the boycott has become national news, it has attracted support around the country. A letter in solidarity with the Garfield teachers has been signed by close to 5,000 educators, authors and activists, including former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch; Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis; Jonathan Kozol, author of Savage Inequalities; Deborah Meier of the Coalition of Essential Schools; Pedro Noguera, professor of education at New York University and more than a dozen faculty members at the City University of New York. During a \xe2\x80\x9cnational day of action\xe2\x80\x9d on Feb. 6, events were held in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, OR, Berkeley, CA and Rochester, NY.\nFIRM STAND\nThe Seattle teachers\xe2\x80\x99 firm stand has been \xe2\x80\x9camazing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jean Anyon, professor of social and educational policy at the CUNY Graduate Center. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have been very few groups that have decided to defy these tests,\xe2\x80\x9d she pointed out. \xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of an outright boycott by a[n entire] school, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first, it\xe2\x80\x99s close to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe MAP test was acquired for about $4 million by former Seattle schools superintendent Maria Goodloe-Johnson while she was on the board of the company that sells it; a state audit in 2011 found that she committed a serious ethics violation by failing to disclose this fact. Ninth and tenth graders in Seattle already take five additional tests required by the state, and eleventh and twelfth graders take three. The MAP is not required by the state and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect students\xe2\x80\x99 grades \xe2\x80\x94 but it is used to evaluate teachers, who point out that many students do not take the test seriously.\nAdditionally, the MAP is a computer-adaptive test, which means that if the student gets a question wrong, the next one is easier; if she gets an answer right, the next one is harder. \xe2\x80\x9cStudents who are...sick of assessments find out quickly that if they choose random answers, the questions get easier,\xe2\x80\x9d writes assessment expert Jem Muldoon.\nIra Shor, a professor of English at the CUNY Graduate Center who writes on composition theory and urban education, said that many tests used in K-12 assessment \xe2\x80\x9cproduce unreliable, unreproducible and even faked results. Yet these tests are used to judge what students know and how well teachers are doing their job.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRISING CONCERNS\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll over the country, parents, teachers, superintendents, lawyers and university folks have been signing petitions and publishing articles about the grotesque misuse of high-stakes testing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michelle Fine, distinguished professor of psychology and urban education at the Graduate Center. But those protests have gained little traction, she added \xe2\x80\x94 in part because the Obama administration \xe2\x80\x9chas really endorsed the overuse of high-stakes testing on students, on teachers and on schools.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTeachers\xe2\x80\x99 opposition to the resulting distortions of education has been on the rise, and misuse of testing was a central issue in the Chicago Teachers Union strike last fall.\nSeattle\xe2\x80\x99s dissident teachers originally received a Feb. 22 deadline to administer the MAP or face a 10-day suspension without pay. Seattle schools superintendent Jose Banda withdrew that threat on Feb. 4 but then ordered Garfield administrators to administer the test the following day. A contributor to the scrapthemap.wordpress.com website described the scene:\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmins came into classrooms and tried to pull students out to take the MAP test in the library. Students stared straight ahead, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t budge.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a library with about 60 computer stations set up for the MAP, there were single digit numbers of students sitting at computers. Of those, many sat at the computers and refused to press even a single button.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBanda has also announced that he\xe2\x80\x99ll organize a task force to investigate possible alternatives to the testing regime and the MAP in particular, but the teachers are refusing to back down. Ravitch and other supporters have vowed to raise money for them if they are suspended.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that high-stakes tests are being used to redline the poor and working class out of access to a quality education, and are used to get rid of teachers\xe2\x80\x9d in ways that are hard to justify, said Fine.\nAn earlier version of this article appeared in Clarion, the newspaper of the Professional Staff Congress/CUNY, the union local that represents faculty and staff at the City University of New York.\n'",b'\n',"b'February 21, 2013'","b'I take pride in standing up to bullies, especially landlords. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a career of fighting for justice for the underdog. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always known I wanted to be a lawyer since my youngest days growing up in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin (population 13,000). But with seven siblings and parents who had to quit school to work on the farm, there was no imagining that any of us would go to college.\nTwo of my brothers did, and had to work full-time and take breaks between semesters to save up money, and battle serious illness without health insurance. Accepting financial aid did not fit with the family\xe2\x80\x99s sense of rugged self-reliance.

That took this nascent feminist as far as a fashion merchandising class at Madison Area Technical College, and there, I learned about financial aid. The lesson came from a slightly lecherous counselor who put his arm around me and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason you can\xe2\x80\x99t be a lawyer if you really want to.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, when I later took out loans out to enter law school, my non-college siblings derided me as a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessional student.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut the door was opened to me. I enrolled in political science at MATC and was turned on to Saul Alinsky\xe2\x80\x99s Rules for Radicals. Alinsky spoke more truth in a paragraph than I\xe2\x80\x99d gained during 12 years of attending Catholic Church and being told to turn the other cheek. I ate up his advice for how to change the world. I knew from observing the Vietnam War and Watergate that there was no justice except that which one could bring about oneself.\nTransferring to the University of Wisconsin-Madison to study history, Black history and women\xe2\x80\x99s studies, I was in heaven. And after graduating, I became pregnant. This was 1982, less than a decade after the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion. My best friend drove me 70 miles to Milwaukee to obtain an abortion through Planned Parenthood. Back in Madison, there were no jobs, even for college grads as the nation was in the middle of a deep recession. The welfare department was only too glad to give me a free, one-way bus ticket to New York City. I had to find a job immediately, and then an apartment; hard enough for a 23-year-old but how much more difficult if I\xe2\x80\x99d had to drag along a child! To earn money, I worked for eight months before law school began, as a receptionist for an air conditioning company, commuting from my shared apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.\nLaw school required 10 hours of classes and study every day. Plus, I wanted to be involved with the community where I lived in Newark, NJ portions of which were contaminated by Agent Orange which had been manufactured there. I did work-study but needed student loans to pay for tuition, food and rent. In truth, I could have worked full-time and gone to law school at night for four years instead of finishing in three, but it would have been involuntary servitude to have to provide for an unwanted child, all the more so as the father was homeless at this time.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never had regrets about my abortion. Feminism took me from being a very depressed teenager who believed what the mean boys said to me \xe2\x80\x93 that I was ugly and no one would ever love me \xe2\x80\x93 and opened new possibilities for me to leave the tradition-bound world I grew up in and pursue my life\xe2\x80\x99s dreams. When those dreams were almost snuffed out, Roe v. Wade allowed me to remain the master of my own destiny.

Memories like steam leave the person confused, ashamed and scared. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse won\xe2\x80\x99t know for years what happened to their bodies. The hot hands of the pedophile are folded into the depths of forgetting until some jarring moment, some odd connection opens a passageway to daylight. When the pedophile\xe2\x80\x99s face becomes visible in the mind, the next shock is that it\xe2\x80\x99s someone they know.\nAnd what if that face is supposed to be the face of God? It is a learned fear and respect for figures of authority that creates silent victims of abuse. Their mute suffering deepens to the degree that the sexual predator has social status, which is why for decades, pedophile priests were invisible: above them was the blinding light of God. It has only been in the past two decades that the mystique of the Catholic Church has been eroded enough for everyone to see the shifty shuffling of pedophiles from one parish to another by church leaders in Rome, including former Pope Benedict Ratzinger.\nThe Catholic Church, with its 1.2 billion followers, is the largest Christian denomination in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s a top-down hierarchy: standing at the summit is the Pope, an elderly man who is God\xe2\x80\x99s representative on earth; next are the dioceses, which are led by a bishop; below them are the parishes, which are overseen by priests, deacons or lay ministers. Ornate Catholic churches can be seen in every country, sometimes nestled between tall modern skyscrapers, sometimes in the tangled foliage of the country. For hundreds of years, millions of people have gone through those doors in search of salvation and now we learn, many have emerged scarred with guilt and shame.\nThe reported numbers on child sex abuse are inevitably too low. Many victims are too ashamed to speak. Many are silenced when they do. And some kill themselves because the pain is too great to endure. Only a few victims fight back. Only 3,000 lawsuits have been filed against the church. According to bishopaccountability.org, U.S. bishops received allegations of abuse directed at about 6,115 priests from 1950 to 2011, and they calculated about 16,324 victims or about three per priest. Based on a report by the Dallas Morning News, at least two-thirds of U.S. bishops kept priests accused of pedophilia serving in the ministry and moved them to new assignments.\nBut why this culture of sexual predation? Maybe it is because the first victim of monotheistic religion is the body itself. Clerical celibacy, the idea that one must sacrifice bodily desires to be closer to God, comes from the separation of the body and the soul that is at the core of church doctrine. The temptations of the flesh are seen as dangerous diversions. The body is a vehicle for the transmission of life, a sacred essence that comes from the Lord, and life must be valued above all. Masturbation and contraception are wrong because they waste the \xe2\x80\x9cseed.\xe2\x80\x9d Abortion is wrong because it kills life. Sex outside of marriage and not for procreation is wrong. The only right way to live one\xe2\x80\x99s sexuality is to have unprotected sex within marriage.\nIf you intend to serve God within the church, you must renounce even sex within marriage to be absolutely dedicated to the divine messages God whispers into the world. The body is a swamp of desire that one can escape by climbing the glowing steps of prayer. And these social ideals, set in the early centuries of Christianity, are a giant anchor embedded in the past that is being stretched to snapping as history moves forward.\nSo here\xe2\x80\x99s the picture: the Catholic Church, a global institution of 1.2 billion people, a network of churches that span the world, has been led by a cabal of chaste men who preach against bodily desires to the millions of people who pour through the pews. And yet in the dark quiet rectories, some of these men have, like cheetahs in National Geographic shows, isolated young, weak or helpless believers to prey upon and feed their hunger for sex and power. The others who are not targeted leave the church, erotically mangled as they vacillate between their desires and the ideas they are taught come from God.\nChild sexual abuse is the most extreme form of the violence the church does to the erotic body. It is one pole on a spectrum that includes unwanted pregnancy, unequal power relationships between men and women, guilt at masturbation, self-destructive rebellion against those very religious rules or the \xe2\x80\x9cCatholic girl gone bad\xe2\x80\x9d stereotype and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases because of the prohibition on contraception.\nThe only protection the church has is people\xe2\x80\x99s habitual, learned subservience to power. Once that breaks, so will its hold on human history. So let\xe2\x80\x99s imagine the new Pope Francis at the Vatican. He recently held his first homily saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us protect Christ in our lives, so we can protect others.\xe2\x80\x9d Thousands of Catholics sat in hot sunlight and fanned their faces. The Pope paused as he shuffled his pages, so imagine in that moment, a hundred people in audience standing up and unfolding a banner that reads, \xe2\x80\x9cI was raped by a priest and the church protected him.\xe2\x80\x9d Imagine reporters rushing the barricades, aiming cameras at the protesters as burly security men plow through the seats to wrestle them down.\n'",b'\n',"b'April 4, 2013'","b'The following testimonies are taken from the recently released clergy files of the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which made public the personnel records of priests accused of sexually abusing children on Jan. 31. The court-ordered release of the 12,000 documents came from the largest archdiocese in the nation and was accompanied by the removal of a top clergyman, Cardinal Roger Mahoney, who had been linked to efforts to conceal the abuse. In March, Cardinal Mahoney traveled to Rome to participate in the election of the new pope.\nFROM THE FILES:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn March of 1993 I began to see a picture of a room inside my head. It would pop into my thoughts randomly and frequently\xe2\x80\xa6Each time the room popped into my head I tried to find a quiet place to allow the experience to unfold. Most of the time, I would just lay on the floor in the fetal position crying, never knowing why. Eventually the room began to invade my meditation and my sleep. I seemed to be particularly afraid of a chair in the room. Again, I did not know why. I had begun to journal after these experiences. My journal entry on June 19, 1993 reads, \xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t sit in that chair, Fr. Joe touches me in that chair.\xe2\x80\x99 After I wrote it I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98why did I just write that?\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn June 24, 1993 I was unable to sleep. The library was haunting me. I gave in out of sheer frustration. Again my body began to shake, I was overcome with extreme fear and a sense of danger. Then I began to feel my vagina being penetrated over and over again. The picture became clear, it was Father Joe and I was sitting in his lap. It was his fingers that I was feeling\xe2\x80\xa6I was in shock. How could I forget something this serious? It was unbelievable. It must be a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Sex abuse survivor testimony in reference to Reverend Joseph Alzugaray\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Barmasse acknowledged that an incident had occurred in 1983\xe2\x80\xa6He explained that he had invited a group of altar servers to a movie but they all canceled except one boy. Instead of going out, Father Barmasse invited the boy to watch a video in the rectory. The movie was Jaws. Father Barmasse reported that that while they were watching the movie, the boy commented that when his family watched videos at home they gave each other massages. Father Barmasse then asked the boy if he wanted a massage and the boy said yes. The youngster was about 12 years old. He lay on his stomach and Father Barmasse lifted up his shirt to massage his shoulders and back. He then undid the boy\xe2\x80\x99s jeans and pulled them down in order to massage the boy\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Report by Staff Psychiatrist at the St. Luke Institute in reference to Reverend Kevin Barmasse\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cTook notes for\xc2\xa0 hour \xe2\x80\x94 stretched and he offered to give me a backrub. Tour of rectory \xe2\x80\x94 up to his room \xe2\x80\x94 bear hug. Then he kissed me and forced his tongue in my mouth. He saw I was afraid; sat me down, gave me a soda; then laid me on the sofa \xe2\x80\x94 began kissing me with his tongue, put his hand on my crotch, rubbing me to erection, asked me to take down my pants. Then I said, \xe2\x80\x98I have to go.\xe2\x80\x99 Offered to take me back to St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s, my Episcopal church\xe2\x80\xa6on the way to St. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s in the car, he begged me not to tell anyone \xe2\x80\x94 that it would ruin him and nobody would believe me anyway. I felt ashamed; was very scared and didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would believe me. I have carried it since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Sex abuse survivor testimony in reference to Reverend Leland Boyer\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther instances happened at the Botanical Gardens in Santa Barbara. We would go there to take walks and he would reach out and hold my hand as we were walking. At some point during the walk he would find a secluded spot and sit me down on the ground or bench or one time it was a rock. He would then begin kissing me, always with his tongue all over the place in my mouth. He would begin touching me all over my body and the touching progressed to where he would unbutton or take off my shirt and fondle and kiss and suck on my breasts for lengthy periods of time. His hands would also be all over the rest of my body.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne time he took me to the beach to take my picture. After he took the picture he began molesting me. He was lying on top of me rubbing himself against me until he ejaculated. When he was finished he stood up and I noticed that he had a big wet spot on the front of his pants. He just untucked his shirt. On that day my parents had invited him to my house for dinner. He just drove me there with his shirt untucked and sat at our dinner table with his pants still wet from the molestation. I was terrified.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Sex abuse survivor testimony in reference to Reverend Michael S. Terra\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather was friendly, took us to the movies a lot. I\xe2\x80\x99d see him almost every day on the playground at St. Barnabas. He\xe2\x80\x99d take several of us to movies. In time, he would take only me. Toward the end of 7th grade, he started talking to me after a movie in his car. He said \xe2\x80\x98You are a lot more to me than a friend.\xe2\x80\x99 He reached over and put his hand on my lap, asked me if that was all right. I said I was uncomfortable. He said, \xe2\x80\x98Sorry, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do that again.\xe2\x80\x99 A week later, he began giving me gifts, tried it again. He kept pursuing me, asked me to movies a lot. People really liked Father Llanos, he sang well, changed the Mass around in the way people liked.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he would approach me at school, he would say, \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with this, nothing wrong with the way I feel about you.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99d grab my butt from behind, harassed me a lot; I was more scared than anything else. Kept giving me gifts and calling up. He\xe2\x80\x99d pull my hand over his groin many times.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Sex abuse survivor testimony in reference to Reverend Theodore Llanos\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe year 1947. I was 7 years old \xe2\x80\x94 just a little child. You were assisting at St. Alphonsus parish in East Los Angeles. One day I was in the school cafeteria, adjoining the parish auditorium. My mother was visiting with the lunchroom ladies. You knew my mother well. She drove the school bus and did some secretarial work in the rectory. Perhaps your relationship with her brought you into contact with me...You were there that day and somehow managed to get me into the auditorium. The auditorium was dark. Rows and rows of chairs were set up. A movie projector was in place. You put the projector on. Then you sat me on your lap, held me, and began to sexually abuse me. You placed your fingers in my vagina. It seemed as if at least fifteen minutes passed before you were finished with me. I remember the moment you left me standing alone as you went on your way. I was confused, alone and afraid. I locked myself in the parish hall bathroom. I never told anyone. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Sex abuse survivor testimony in reference to Reverend George Rucker\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral years ago my sister was molested, possibly raped by a Fr. Joseph D. Pina, pastor of St. Alphonsus Church\xe2\x80\xa6So why do I write? Well its because after all these years I have had much time to reflect about the situation. Much anger, fear, and frustration has been part of me and my family. None of us have been able to completely enjoy our lives. A deep wedge has been hammered into my family, driving each other away because of this event. Also though the faith my sisters had by this time began to deteriorate, the things Fr. Joe Pina did greatly contributed for them to further themselves from the Church.\nSo my question is why did the church do nothing to remedy this? If Fr. Pina had reported it why did Your office remain quiet when you had a moral obligation to address this issue. Nothing really has been done to Fr. Joe, other than getting psychological help but what about getting help for my sister and my family? Several times my sister has vocalized gettinq help but due to her financial situation she has not been able to get long term help. Mr. Archbishop it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the money but the feeling of isolation and lack of response from a church I believed in. Even my father\xe2\x80\x99s, who I believe is an extremely devoted my man, faith has been shook up violently. All I want is for the Church to deal with this situation honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Letter to the Church in reference to Reverend Joseph Pina from the brother of a sex abuse survivor\n\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warned you twenty four years ago to stay away from me. Remember that phone call?...Let me refresh your memory. Remember the dinners at the Azteca Restaurant? Remember ordering drinks for both of us? Remember kissing me on the lips and telling me that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t unusual behavior with men in European cultures? Remember asking me about how often I masturbated? Remember telling me that you also masturbated? Remember the foreign film that we saw together in Santa Monica that you insisted I see? Remember the homosexual sex scenes? Remember how interested you were in my sex life with my girlfriend? Remember telling me that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody else what we talk about? That they might not understand? Remember the Cognac we drank together at your residence? Remember asking to see the birthmark on my penis? Remember, remember, remember!\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Cronin, my memory is very clear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Sex abuse survivor testimony in reference to Reverend Sean Cronin\n'",b'\n',"b'April 3, 2013'","b'I was in a military courtroom at Ft. Meade in Maryland on Feb. 28 as Pfc. Bradley Manning admitted giving classified government documents to WikiLeaks. The hundreds of thousands of leaked documents exposed U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as government misconduct. A statement that Manning made to the court was a powerful and moving treatise on the importance of placing conscience above personal safety, the necessity of sacrificing careers and liberty for the public good, and the moral imperative of carrying out acts of defiance. Manning will surely pay with many years \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps his entire life \xe2\x80\x94 in prison. But we too will pay. The war against Bradley Manning is a war against us all.\nThis trial is not simply the prosecution of a 25-year-old soldier who had the temerity to report to the outside world the indiscriminate slaughter, war crimes, torture and abuse that are carried out by our government and our occupation forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a concerted effort by the security and surveillance state to extinguish what is left of a free press, one that has the constitutional right to expose crimes by those in power. The lonely individuals who take personal risks so that the public can know the truth are from now on to be charged with \xe2\x80\x9caiding the enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d All those within the system who publicly reveal facts that challenge the official narrative will be imprisoned, as was John Kiriakou, the former CIA analyst who exposed the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s use of torture and began serving a 30-month prison term the day Manning read his statement. There is a word for states that create these kinds of information\n\tvacuums: totalitarian.\nThe cowardice of The New York Times, El Pais, Der Spiegel and Le Monde, all of which used masses of the material Manning passed on to WikiLeaks and then callously turned their backs on him, is one of journalism\xe2\x80\x99s greatest shames. These publications made little effort to cover Manning\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial hearings, a failure that shows how bankrupt and anemic the commercial press has become. Rescuing what honor of our trade remains has been left to a handful of independent, often marginalized reporters and a small number of other individuals and groups. But if our domesticated press institutions believe that by refusing to defend or report on Manning they will escape the wrath of the security and surveillance state, they are stunningly naive. This is a war that is being played for keeps. And the goal of the state is not simply to send Manning away for life. The state is also determined to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and try him in the United States on espionage or conspiracy charges. The state hopes to cement into place systems of information that will do little more than parrot official propaganda.\nThe government has decided to press ahead with all 22 charges, including aiding the enemy and espionage. It has refused to settle for Manning\xe2\x80\x99s admission of guilt on 10 lesser offenses that could bring him as many as 20 years in prison. Manning\xe2\x80\x99s leaks, the government insists, are tantamount to support for Al-Qaeda and international terrorism. The government will attempt to prove this point by bringing into court an anonymous witness who most likely took part in the raid on Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound in Pakistan. This witness will reportedly tell the court that copies of the leaked documents were found on Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s computer and assisted al-Qaeda. This is an utterly spurious form of prosecution \xe2\x80\x94 as if any of us have control over the information we provide to the public and how it is used.\nWhen he was secretary of defense, Robert Gates said a Defense Department review determined that the publication of the Iraq War Logs and the Afghan War Diary had \xe2\x80\x9cnot revealed any sensitive intelligence sources and methods.\xe2\x80\x9d In the trial, however, the government must prove only that the \xe2\x80\x9cdisclosure could be potentially damaging to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and need only provide \xe2\x80\x9cindependent proof of at least potential harm to the national security\xe2\x80\x9d beyond mere security classification, writes law professor Geoffrey Stone.\nManning has done what anyone with a conscience should have done. In the courtroom he exhibited \xe2\x80\x94 especially given the prolonged abuse he suffered during his thousand days inside the military prison system \xe2\x80\x94 poise, intelligence and dignity. He appealed to the best within us. And this is why the government fears him. America still produces heroes, some in uniform. But now we lock them up.\nAn extended version of this article originally appeared at truthdig.org.\n'",b'\n',"b'April 3, 2013'","b'\xe2\x80\x98This Type of Information Should Become Public\xe2\x80\x99\nIn a pre-trial hearing on Feb. 28, 2013, 25-year-old U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning admitted for the first time to providing hundreds of thousands of U.S. government documents to WikiLeaks. He pled guilty to 10 of 22 charges being pressed by military prosecutors. Following are excerpts from his hour-and-a-half long testimony in Fort Meade, Md, in which he explained what he leaked and why:\nFROM: FACTS REGARDING THE UNAUTHORIZED STORAGE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE SIGACTS.\nAs I started working with Significant Activities (SIGACTs), I felt they were similar to a daily journal or log that a person may keep. They capture what happens on a particular day and time. They are created immediately after the event and are potentially updated over a period of hours until a final version is published on CIDNE.\nFor me, the SIGACTs represented the on-the-ground reality of both the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I felt we were risking so much for people that seemed unwilling to cooperate with us, leading to frustration and hatred on both sides.\nI began to become depressed at the situation that we found ourselves increasingly mired in, year after year. The SIGACTs documented this in great detail, and provided context to what we were seeing on the ground. In attempting to conduct counter-terrorism (CT) and counter-insurgency (COIN) operations, we became obsessed with capturing and killing human targets on lists, on being suspicious of and avoiding cooperation with our host-nation partners, and ignoring the second and third order effects of accomplishing short-term goals and missions.\nI believed that if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information contained within the CIDNE-I and CIDNE-A tables, this could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general, as well as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan. I also believed a detailed analysis of the data over a long period of time, by different sectors of society, might cause society to re-evaluate the need, or even the desire to engage in CT and COIN operations that ignored the complex dynamics of the people living in the affected environment each day.\nI felt a sense of relief by them [WikiLeaks] having it [the information]. I felt had accomplished something that allowed me to have a clear conscience based upon what I had seen, read about and knew were happening in both Iraq and Afghanistan every day.\nFROM: FACTS REGARDING THE UNAUTHORIZED STORAGE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE 12 JULY 2007 AIR WEAPONS TEAM {AWT) VIDEO.\nThe video depicted a several individuals being engaged by an Air Weapons Team (AWT). At first, I did not consider the video very special, as I had viewed countless other \xe2\x80\x9cwar-porn\xe2\x80\x9d type videos depicting combat. However, the recorded audio comments by the AWT crew and the second engagement in the video, of an unarmed bongo truck, troubled me.\nUsing Google, I searched for the event by its date and general location. I found several news accounts involving two Reuters employees who were killed during the AWT\xe2\x80\x99s engagement. Another story explained that Reuters requested for a copy of the video under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\nDespite the submission of a FOIA request, the news account explained that CENTCOM (U.S. Central Command) replied to Reuters, stating that they could not give a timeframe for considering the FOIA request, and the video might no longer exist. Another story I found, written a year later, said that even though Reuters was still pursuing their request, they still did not receive a formal response or written determination in accordance with the FOIA.\nThe fact neither CENTCOM nor Multi-National Forces-Iraq (MCF-I) would not voluntarily release the video troubled me further. It was clear to me that the event happened because the AWT mistakenly identified the Reuters employees with a potential threat, and that the people in the bongo truck were merely attempting to assist the wounded. The people in the van were not a threat, but \xe2\x80\x9cgood Samaritans.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe most alarming aspect of the video to me, however, was the seemingly delightful bloodlust they appeared to have. They dehumanized the individuals they were engaging, and seemed to not value human life by referring to them as \xe2\x80\x9cdead bastards\xe2\x80\x9d and congratulating each other on the ability to kill in large numbers.\nAt one point in the video, there is an individual on the ground attempting to crawl to safety. The individual is seriously wounded. Instead of calling for medical attention to the location, one of the AWT crew members verbally asked for the wounded person to pick up a weapon so he would have a reason to engage. For me, this seems similar to a child torturing ants with a magnifying glass.\nFROM: FACTS REGARDING THE UNAUTHORIZED STORAGE AND DISCLOSURE OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO DETAINMENTS BY THE IRAQI FEDERAL POLICE (FP), THE DETAINEE ASSESSMENT BRIEFS (DABS), AND THE USACIC REPORT.\nA report was received from a subordinate battalion. The report described an event in which the FP detained 15 individuals for printing \xe2\x80\x9canti-Iraqi\xe2\x80\x9d literature\xe2\x80\xa6Over the course of my research I found that none of the individuals had previous ties to anti-Iraqi actions or suspected terrorist militia groups.\n[The unit interpreter] said the general nature of the document was benign. The documentation, as I assessed as well, was merely a scholarly critique of the then-current Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. It detailed corruption within the cabinet of al-Maliki\xe2\x80\x99s government and the financial impact of his corruption on the Iraqi people. After discovering this discrepancy between the FP\xe2\x80\x99s report and the interpreter\xe2\x80\x99s transcript, I forwarded this discovery to the TOC OIC and the battle NCOIC.\nThe TOC OIC and, the overhearing Battle Captain, informed me they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need or want to know this information any more. They told me to \xe2\x80\x9cdrop it\xe2\x80\x9d and to just assist them and the FP in finding out where more of these print shops creating \xe2\x80\x9canti-Iraqi literature\xe2\x80\x9d might be. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what I heard.\nI am the type of person who likes to know how things work, and as an analyst, this means I always want to figure out the truth. Unlike other analysts in my section, or other sections within 2-10BCT, I was not satisfied with just scratching the surface, and producing \xe2\x80\x9ccanned\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccookie cutter\xe2\x80\x9d assessments. I wanted to know why something was the way it was, and what we could do to correct or mitigate a situation. I knew that if I continued to assist the Baghdad FP in identifying the political opponents of Prime Minister al-Maliki, those people would be arrested, and in the custody of this special unit of the Baghdad FP, very likely tortured and not seen again for a very long time, if ever.\nInstead of assisting the special unit of the Baghdad FP, I decided to take the information and disclose it to the WLO in the hope that, before the upcoming 7 March 2010 election, they could generate immediate press on the issue, and prevent this unit of the FP from continuing to crack down on political opponents.\nAt the same time, I began sifting through information from the U. S . Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) and Joint Task Force (JTF) Guantanamo, Cuba (GTMO). The thought occurred to me, although unlikely, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the individuals detained by the FP might be turned over back into U.S. custody and ending up in the custody of JTF-GTMO.\nI have always been interested on the issue of the moral efficacy of our actions surrounding JTF-GTMO. On the one hand, I always understood the need to detain and interrogate individuals who might wish to harm the U.S. and our allies. I felt that was what we were trying to do at JTF-GTMO. However, the more I became educated on the topic, it seemed that we found ourselves holding an increasing number of individuals indefinitely that we believed or knew were innocent, low-level \xe2\x80\x9cfoot soldiers\xe2\x80\x9d that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have useful intelligence and would be released if they were still held in theater.\nI also recalled that in early 2009, the then-newly-elected president, Barack Obama, stated he would close JTF-GTMO and that the facility compromised our standing in the world and diminished our \xe2\x80\x9cmoral authority.\xe2\x80\x9d After familiarizing myself with the Detainee Assessment Briefs, I agreed.\nFROM: FACTS REGARDING THE UNAUTHORIZED STORAGE AND DISCLOSURE OF THE NCD DOS CABLES.\nDuring this time, I had nothing but work to distract me. I read more of the diplomatic cables published on the Department of State (DOS) Net Centric Diplomacy (NCD) server. With my insatiable curiosity and interest in geopolitics, I became fascinated with them. I read not only cables on Iraq, but also about countries and events I found interesting. The more I read, the more I was fascinated by the way we dealt with other nations and organizations. I also began to think that they documented backdoor deals and seemingly criminal activity that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem characteristic of the de facto leader of the free world.\nUp to this point during the deployment, I had issues I struggled with and difficulty at work. Of the documents released, the cables are the only one I was not absolutely certain couldn\xe2\x80\x99t harm the U.S. I conducted research on the cables published on NCD, as well as how DOS cables work in general.\nThe more I read the cables, the more I came to the conclusion that this type of information should become public. I once read and used a quote on open diplomacy written after the First World War, and how the world would be a better place if states would avoid making secret pacts and deals with and against each other. I thought these cables were a prime example of the need for a more open diplomacy. Given all the DOS information I read, the fact that most of the cables were unclassified, and that all of the cables had the SIPDIS caption, I believed that the public release of these cables would not damage the U.S. However, I did believe the cables might be embarrassing, since they represented very honest opinions and statements behind the backs of other nations and organizations. In many ways, these cables are a catalog of cliques and gossip. I believed exposing this information might make some within the DOS and others unhappy.\n'",b'\n',"b'April 3, 2013'","b'Late on the Thursday afternoon before spring break 15 teachers gathered around a long table in the back corner of a tapas bar in Chelsea.\nFaced with a daily grind of standardized test prep, performance metrics, data management and pervasive job insecurity that increasingly defines their existence as teachers, they were looking forward to a week\xe2\x80\x99s respite. But, they were also discussing this April\xe2\x80\x99s elections in the United Federation of Teachers and how they might be able to rejuvenate a union that they say has failed to effectively resist the corporate-style education reforms that Mayor Michael Bloomberg has implemented over the past 12 years.\n\xe2\x80\x9cResistance is not futile if we join forces with the people in the communities we serve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sean Ahern, a teacher who works with troubled youth at Rikers Island, as the group went around the table introducing themselves and describing the teaching work they do.\nThe happy hour gathering was organized by the Movement of Rank and File Educators (MORE), an opposition caucus that is battling the UFT\xe2\x80\x99s entrenched leadership. The union is seeing growing discontent among the rank-and-file as members are battered by the changes Bloomberg and his corporate allies have implemented. The meetup was a chance for teachers who are starting to become involved to meet with colleagues who are already active in MORE.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeachers are scared. The UFT can\xe2\x80\x99t protect them, which is why people are looking more favorably on MORE,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gloria Brandman, a Brooklyn elementary school teacher and one of MORE\xe2\x80\x99s co-founders.\nThat message resonated with Henry Funes, a 25-year teaching veteran. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it as bad as this. We\xe2\x80\x99re virtually powerless and voiceless,\xe2\x80\x9d Funes said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe UFT\xe2\x80\x99s attitude is, \xe2\x80\x98be grateful you have a job.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nREBUILDING\nMORE was formed last year by members of several left-leaning teacher groups. Many MORE members have joined protests in recent years against school closings and charter school co-locations inside existing public schools carried out by the NYC Department of Education. In the 170,000-member UFT, they see an institution with the resources and the citywide reach into school communities to lead a powerful fightback against Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s policies \xe2\x80\x94 including mayoral control of schools \xe2\x80\x94 which have proven increasingly unpopular with parents. But first, they say, the UFT must transform itself and become an organization that fully encourages member participation and forges strong ties with the communities it serves.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe membership is not educated, organized and mobilized, and that has hurt us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julie Cavanagh, an elementary school special education teacher who is MORE\xe2\x80\x99s candidate for president against UFT chief Michael Mulgrew.\nCavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy is a by-product of New York\xe2\x80\x99s school wars. She first became politicized several years ago when she led a community struggle in Red Hook against a politically-connected charter school that was looking to take over much of the school where she teaches.\nCampaigning with minimal resources, MORE has held happy hour gatherings like the one in Chelsea, organized public forums to discuss issues of importance to educators, set up social media sites and email lists, and distributed tens of thousands of flyers to members at school campuses. It\xe2\x80\x99s this kind of patient, bottom-up organizing that MORE activists hope will enable them to make inroads this year against the Unity Caucus, which has controlled the UFT since shortly after its founding in 1960.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey [MORE] are bringing the message that you are not alone to teachers who want to resist,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lois Weiner, a professor of education at New Jersey University and the author of The Future of Our Schools: Teachers Unions and Social Justice. Voting in the elections runs from April 3 to 25.\nCHICAGO STORY\nFor inspiration, MORE looks to the militant Chicago Teachers Union and the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators (CORE), the left caucus that vaulted into power in 2010. CORE\xe2\x80\x99s victory was fueled by rank-and-file dissatisfaction with the response of union leaders to attacks on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s public school system by city leaders. Before taking the helm at CTU, teachers from CORE had spent years fighting alongside parent and community groups to prevent schoolclosings. When the CTU launched a week-long strike last September, parents, students and community members poured into the streets to show their support for the teachers forcing Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to settle a favorable contract with the union.\nHowever, circumstances are different in the two cities.\nIn New York, the legacy of the racially-charged 1968 teachers strike carried out across the city by the UFT to squash an experiment with community control of schools in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville still lingers over the union 45 years later like an unacknowledged curse.\nIn Chicago, the CTU\xe2\x80\x99s previous incumbents were poorly organized whereas the UFT has been controlled by the Unity Caucus for half a century.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a mass machine that has to be battled at the school level and the district level,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norm Scott, a retired teacher and education blogger who is active in MORE.\nDespite all its top-down power, the UFT has little impact in the daily life of many of the city\xe2\x80\x99s 1,700 public schools. With MORE\xe2\x80\x99s chances of victory in this election almost nil, organizers see this year\xe2\x80\x99s campaign as an opportunity to build a school-level network of supporters that can continue to grow and win more chapter elections in 2015 and pose a stronger challenge in the next union-wide elections in 2016. Their success will be determined to a large extent by their ability to connect with and move union members who do not already self-identify as leftists.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in this for the long haul,\xe2\x80\x9d Cavanagh said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a much stronger place in three years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor more information, see morecaucus.org or ednotesonline.blogspot.com.\n'",b'\n',"b'April 30, 2013'","b'The New York State Youth Leadership Council is an organization of, by and for undocumented youth. Like their counterparts in other states, its members have broken through the fear that has gripped immigrant communities in recent years by ""coming out"" in public as ""undocumented and unafraid."" In the process, they have wrought a movement that has helped put immigration reform back on the map and forced both major parties to express support for the DREAM Act \xe2\x80\x94 federal legislation that would make it easier for undocumented youth, known as ""Dreamers,"" to attend college and earn a path to citizenship. During March, the YLC celebrated its fourth annual ""Coming Out of the Shadows Month."" NYC events included a series of ""UndocuMics,"" writing workshops, and a Coming Out Rally (see photos below) in Union Square on March 28.\n\nDIANA EUSEBIO\n\tDiana Eusebio came to this country when she was six, along with her two older brothers and her father, soon after the death of her mother in Mexico. She grew up in Florida, until Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its Secure Communities program tore her family apart: ""My brother was stopped in Florida for driving without a license. And, because of Secure Communities, he was sent to an ICE immigration facility, and he was deported.""\n\tAfter her brother\'s deportation, Diana moved to New York, where she enrolled in the Hostos Lincoln Academy of Science in the Bronx and quickly joined the undocumented student movement. Diana cites her older brother as her inspiration for coming out, telling her story and sharing her struggles as an undocumented immigrant. ""He didn\'t have the chance to come out to tell his story,"" she says, so ""I am the one advocating for my family. I am telling my story, their story, our story, because he didn\'t have the chance to.""\n\nLEYDI BAUTISTA LA VOZ\n\tLeydi Bautista La Voz left her hometown in the state of Puebla, Mexico when she was eight. ""I am proud of my roots, no matter what,"" she says. Together with her mother and two brothers, she came to this country without papers. From her very first day at school, she felt she was targeted for being an immigrant. ""It was very painful. I knew I didn\'t belong here."" But Leydi, now 20 and a mother of two, has not let her undocumented status keep her back. Alongside the New York State Youth Leadership Council, she also works with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. Pointing to her two young boys, Josue and Henry, Leydi insists, ""They are the reason I want to say, \xc3\x94It\'s enough. It\'s time.\' I deserve to have the right to go to college so I can give a better future to them. Yes, I am a young mom, but that doesn\'t make me garbage. I am worth it.""\n\nPERCY LUJAN\n\tPercy Lujan arrived in the US at the age of 11, along with his family, in search of ""better economic opportunities"" than they had found in the wake of the U.S-backed dictatorship in Peru. ""I knew from the get-go that I was undocumented,"" he remembers. Unlike most undocumented youth in New York, however, Percy was eventually able to win a full scholarship to Lehman College, in the Bronx. ""Most of the smart people that we see in college are very lucky,"" he says. ""Many of the smart people we know are working...as dishwashers or busboys...as housekeepers or babysitters.""\n\tWhen Percy got to Lehman, he helped found a campus group that advocates for undocumented students, as he came to realize that ""rights are not granted to us... We have to fight for them."" He vows to continue this fight once he gets legal status: ""I don\'t think my struggles are unique...I think they are part of a bigger movement for justice. I won\'t stop until everyone has liberty and justice.""\n\nNERIEL DAVID PONC\xc3\x89\n\tNeriel David Ponc\xc2\x8e\xc3\xa9 immigrated to this country from the Philippines when he was only 5 years old. ""My family came here, they worked their asses off,"" he recounts, adding, ""I don\'t want to see them go."" Neriel (pictured right, holding sign) didn\'t learn about his own legal status until it came time to apply for college. He speaks of ""the heartbreaking moment"" for students like him, ""when they find out they don\'t have any means to pay for college, or any help from the government.""\n\tNeriel is now in his senior year of high school. He hopes to continue his studies, and has been accepted to SUNY, CUNY, and private schools alike \xe2\x80\x94 but, he says, ""I can\'t afford any of this."" In spite of his personal struggles, Neriel aspires to be ""a voice to others out there. To reach out to them. To find hope, and to fight for this cause."" To this end, he has helped organize a group called Revolutionizing Asian-American Immigrant Stories on the East Coast (or RAISE), a youth-led group that aims to empower undocumented Asian students ""to share their struggles and find a voice amid the culture of silence."" What we need now, he says, is ""for the students to be heard.""\nFor more about the New York State Youth Leadership Council, see www.nysylc.org.\nFor more, see:\nShaping the U.S. of the 21st Century, by Juan Gonz\xc3\xa1lez\nFighting for a Place to Call Home, by Michael Gould-Wartofsky\nCulture Clash: Confronting Nativists in the Jersey Suburbs, by Marty Kirchner\nA Day Laborer Says, \xe2\x80\x98We Deserve the Chance to Become Full Members of the Society We Contribute to Every Day,\xe2\x80\x99 by Robert Meneses\n'",b'\n',"b'April 30, 2013'","b'2001\nIn the weeks and months following 9/11, the city\'s Arab, Muslim and South Asian communities find themselves under siege from all sides: from federal authorities to local law enforcement, and from employers to landlords to racist vigilantes. At the federal level, over 1,200 Arab, Muslim and South Asian New Yorkers are targeted for ""special interest"" roundups and secret detentions, many of them held for months without charge. Immigrants and their allies organize in defense of their civil rights, with educational campaigns, legal advocacy efforts, volunteer escorts and solidarity actions at Immigration and Naturalization Service offices and detention centers.\n2002\nIn October 2002, thousands of young men from 25 primarily Muslim countries are subjected to ""special registrations,"" at which they are interrogated about their politics, finances and immigration status. Over 3,000 New Yorkers are deported under the program from 2002-3. Meanwhile, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 leads to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, with the newly minted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as its ""principal investigative arm."" By 2004, ICE apprehensions reached 1 million immigrants annually, and more than 200,000 were placed in detention centers. The offensive is met with widespread resistance in NYC. Families for Freedom, among others, is founded as a ""multi-ethnic defense network by and for immigrants facing and fighting deportation.""\n2003\nImmigrant New Yorkers are at the forefront of a growing anti-detention movement, which helps put a stop to the special registrations in 2003. Amid preparations for the invasion of Iraq, the Department of Homeland Security announces Operation Liberty Shield, authorizing the detention of asylum seekers and the interrogation of immigrants from Iraq and 20 other nations. Meanwhile, in City Hall, Mayor Michael Bloomberg signs Executive Order 34, giving the NYPD and the Department of Corrections the power to investigate the immigration status of any New Yorker and to disclose their immigration status to ICE. Facing massive opposition, the mayor is forced to revise the order later that year but leaves many of its most harmful provisions in place.\n2003-04\nImmigrant labor takes the lead in organizing drives and issue campaigns across the city and state. Domestic Workers United wins the first ever Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, mandating basic labor protections for this largely immigrant workforce in NYC. The Restaurant Opportunities Center organizes non-unionized restaurant workers and wins back millions of dollars in unpaid wages. The NY Immigration Coalition helps launch the Campaign to End Wage Theft and the $5.15 Is Not Enough Campaign, which pressures lawmakers to raise the state\'s minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.15. The local immigrant rights movement also partners with the AFL-CIO to bring tens of thousands out to the Immigrant Worker Freedom Rides in Queens, and tens of thousands more to march for immigrant and labor rights at the Republican National Convention.\n2003-06\nAnti-immigrant violence continues to escalate in the Greater New York region. The escalation mirrors a national trend, with anti-Latino hate crimes rising 40 percent from 2003 to 2006. The violence is increasingly directed at Mexican and Central American immigrants, amid racist rhetoric and incitement from above. Suffolk County, NY is ground zero for the nativist offensive. Day laborers are harassed and beaten, a family of five is firebombed in its home, and groups like Sachem Quality of Life wage a campaign of terror in and around Farmingville, NY. Local initiatives like the Workplace Project and the Long Island Immigrant Alliance push back, fighting racial profiling, educating native-born neighbors and opening centers for day laborers.\n2005-06\nThe anti-immigrant right rallies around the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (H.R. 4437), with its battle cry of ""border security"" and its call for the criminalization of all 11 million undocumented immigrants as well as those who come to their aid. Some immigrant rights advocates ally with business interests and rally around the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act (S. 1033), known as the McCain-Kennedy bill, which includes a path to legalization but also a path to further criminalization and an expansion of the guestworker labor regime. Many immigrant activists and advocates oppose both bills, fearing that they will only serve to legalize the status quo of exclusion and exploitation. Both bills ultimately go down in defeat amid an escalating wave of raids, detentions and deportations.\n2006\nOn March 25, immigrants and their allies stage a million-strong march in the streets of Los Angeles to protest the criminalization of the undocumented. On April 10, tens of thousands of New Yorkers converge on City Hall Park as part of a National Day of Action for Immigrant Justice. Then, on May 1 \xe2\x80\x94 International Workers\' Day \xe2\x80\x94 immigrant workers lead a wave of wildcat strikes and megamarchas, pouring into the streets of over 70 cities in an unprecedented show of force known as ""A Day Without an Immigrant."" In NYC, hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their supporters march from Union Square to Foley Square, filling no less than 26 blocks along Broadway, and chanting ""El pueblo unido, jam\xc2\x87s ser\xc2\x87 vencido."" Hundreds of businesses throughout the city, especially in Brooklyn and Queens, are shuttered for the day.\n2007\nThe New York State Youth Leadership Council is founded by and for undocumented youth to demand equal access to higher education, including in-state tuition and tuition assistance for those who cannot otherwise afford to go to college. Youth have been organizing around the issue since 2001, but the founding of the YLC marks a new chapter in the history of the movement. Beginning in 2007, the DREAM Act advances at the federal and state levels, with the promise that it will make college affordable and offer a path to citizenship to the ""Dreamers."" But the effort is blocked by the nativist bloc in the Senate. In 2009, Dreamers from coast to coast come together to form United We Dream, aimed at ""building a movement that would not hinge on votes in Congress,"" but on youth empowerment and youth-led mobilization at the grassroots.\n2008-10\nAs unemployment soars due to the Great Recession, immigrants across the region and country again find themselves scapegoated for the troubles of their native-born neighbors. The backlash yields a bill in Suffolk County imposing sanctions for immigrant hires, an initiative to turn local police into immigration agents in the Hudson Valley, and SB 1070 in Arizona, a law making it a crime to be without papers. New Yorkers turn out in force to reject the new laws and lend their support to the ""Alto Arizona"" (Stop Arizona) boycott.\n2009-12\nNewly elected President Barack Obama, in spite of campaign promises to change course, continues and even accelerates deportations over the course of his first term. Each passing year marks a new record, with close to 400,000 removal proceedings recorded annually. ICE activity in New York City alone jumped 60 percent since 2006, according to Families for Freedom, with close to 30,000 New Yorkers detained since 2008 and 92 percent of them deported. Police precincts and city jails increasingly serve as direct pipelines to detention and deportation. And in 2012, in spite of local opposition, the Secure Communities (S-Comm) program goes into effect in NYC. Under S-Comm, all law enforcement is linked to immigration enforcement and local police are required to send any and all fingerprints immediately to Department of Homeland Security databases.\n2010-12\nUndocumented students and their allies continue to push for passage of the DREAM Act and a national moratorium on deportations. In the spring of 2010, Dreamers stage a wave of sit-ins, hunger strikes and other actions in and around Congressional offices, including that of NY Senator Chuck Schumer. Over 100 allies are arrested in three weeks of civil disobedience at Manhattan\'s Federal Plaza. Yet the lawmakers remain intransigent. After two years of increasingly confrontational protests, President Obama blinks. In June 2012, the White House announces a ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals"" (DACA) policy, allowing Dreamers to stay in the United States and apply for work permits. While DACA brings a measure of relief to tens of thousands in NYC, it fails to stem the tide of deportations for the rest of the undocumented.\n2011-12\nImmigrant and international activists play a formative role in the organization of Occupy Wall Street, with occupiers from almost every continent bringing their struggles to the table. Early on, immigrant-led unions such as TWU Local 100 are among the first to join the fray. Within days, community organizations, worker centers and allied groups around the city, from El Barrio to Sunset Park, join together to form the Immigrant Worker Justice Working Group. Declaring, ""Immigrants Are the 99%,"" they go on to launch two parallel campaigns, one targeting for-profit detention centers, the other businesses engaged in wage theft. Long after their eviction from Zuccotti, immigrants continue to play a critical role in the movement as a whole, from May Day marches to rent strikes to organizing drives at local eateries and car washes.\n2012\nInvestigative reporters reveal the NYPD and its ""Demographics Unit"" has been spying on members of the Muslim Students Association at more than 20 universities in four states across the Northeast, including six CUNY schools, NYU, Columbia, and Saint John\'s. None of the organizations or ""persons of interest"" was ever accused of any wrongdoing, but that didn\'t stop NYPD detectives from tracking Muslim students through a ""Cyber Intelligence Unit,"" issuing weekly ""MSA Reports,"" or sending undercover operatives to infiltrate campus meetings, seminars and religious observances. The intelligence units in question worked closely with agencies in other cities, as well as an agent on the payroll of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n2013\nThe Senate\'s ""Gang of Eight"" unveils yet another ""bipartisan framework"" for comprehensive immigration reform, claiming to offer a new ""roadmap"" to address the status of undocumented immigrants. Many immigrants are quick to question this roadmap. Its path to citizenship not only takes 13 years and thousands of dollars in fines and fees, but is also ""contingent upon our success in securing our borders,"" as well as an ""E-Verify"" system and a guestworker regime. The House, for its part, promises even harsher legislation. Advocacy groups call on their base to ""fight to protect the good things"" and to ""fight to get rid of the bad."" On April 10, over 3,000 New Yorkers board buses to Washington, D.C. to do just that.\nOn April 15, a pair of bombs go off at the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring over 260. Two legal immigrants of Chechen heritage are later implicated. Yet, long before the suspects\' identities are revealed, a new wave of racial violence ensues, stoked by speculation that the bombers are ""dark-skinned males."" Abdullah Faruque, a New Yorker born in Bangladesh, is brutalized in the Bronx. The backlash following the bombing revives calls for the mass detention of Muslims and threatens to derail efforts to win immigrant rights.\n\t\xc2\xa0\n'",b'\n',"b'April 30, 2013'","b'I am an undocumented day laborer in Queens who has worked in this country for almost 20 years. I do hard, dangerous jobs on construction sites such as demolition or carrying out the trash, when I can get any work at all. I have known many men who have been killed in workplace accidents or who have become gravely ill from breathing in dust due to a lack of adequate protective equipment.\nWe deserve the chance to become full members of the society we contribute to every day. For the past decade, I have heard much in the media about a possible immigration reform law. But, I have learned not to believe it.\nIn the early 2000s, there was talk of the United States and Mexico reaching a comprehensive deal to legalize all undocumented immigrants in return for a free trade deal that would allow private investment in Pemex, Mexico\'s state-owned oil company. Those talks fell apart after 9/11.\nDuring his 2004 re-election campaign, President George W. Bush once again raised hopes of immigration reform to woo the Latino vote, but it was an empty promise.\nIn 2006, we went out into the streets by the millions and our demands continued to be ignored.\nPresident Barack Obama won the Hispanic vote in 2008 by promising that in his first 100 days as president, he would put forth comprehensive immigration reform. Once in office, he said he was too busy dealing with the economic crisis to work on immigration reform.\nToday, in Obama\'s second term as President, we hear the same promise of humane and comprehensive immigration reform.\nBut, I don\'t see it. As far as I can tell from what is being discussed, we are being asked to accept a process toward legalization that would take 10 to 15 years. The only thing being offered is a simple guest worker permit similar to what we already have with the H-2A and H-2B visas.\nMORE EXPLOITATION\nFar from being a solution, work permits are instruments of exploitation for immigrant workers on both sides of the border. In immigrants\' countries of origin, unscrupulous brokers collect large fees promising to help arrange work permits and then disappear with people\'s money. On this side of the border, the bosses expose the workers to long hard hours of labor in unhealthy conditions and without necessary protections. If the workers don\'t like it, they can lose their jobs and their work permits.\nCreating a new set of work permits without a real path to permanent residency and citizenship will only legalize the exploitation we live under while requiring us to go to ""the back of the line"" and pay thousands of dollars in fines and more taxes for the privilege of being treated this way.\nThe Senate\'s bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" (which includes New York Senator Chuck Schumer) may think they are fooling us. But, I can\'t swallow this deception. And I suspect there are many others like me among the 11 million undocumented people in this country who understand what is being proposed and will have no motivation to come ""out of the shadows"" to participate in this process.\nThe distrust that I feel comes from observing two successive presidential administrations, one Republican and the other Democrat. They speak from both sides of their mouth. From one side they spew words of legalization, but on the other side they generate more anti-immigration laws, increase deportations, build detention centers and jails, and pour more investments into the policing the border.\nI am over 45 years old, as are many of the people I work with in construction. And it appears increasingly likely that we will not live long enough to be legalized. This is unjust. After almost two decades in this country, there are a couple of things I have learned: Firstly, don\'t trust the politicians, and secondly, it will only be through our own ability to organize and collectively fight for our rights that we will see improvements in our lives.\nRoberto Meneses is the president of Day Laborers United (Jornaleros Unidos).

By 7:30 a.m. he finds himself alongside other recent immigrants from Guatemala and Mexico hoping a construction contractor, homeowner, or small business owner will drive up and offer a job for the day. Work has been hard to find since the collapse of the housing market in 2007. But the United Patriots of America have not.\nEvery Saturday morning for the past seven years, the UPA -- which models itself after the Arizona-based Minuteman Project -- has been holding rallies in Dumont, a neighboring borough just across the street from the hiring site where Raynaldo and others gather. As many as 15 UPA members regularly assemble at these rallies. They wave U.S. and Arizona flags, carry signs that scapegoat immigrants for the country\'s economic crisis and record video of immigrants seeking work and the employers who hire them. Local police regularly drive through the area and issue tickets to any day laborers found standing outside the city-designated hiring site.\n""I don\'t like the protesters because they always see us as not producing value, but we produce a lot of value for this country economically,"" says Raynaldo. ""If there were no day laborers, or no immigrants then the county\'s economy would go down.""\n""The image I have is of what America looked like in the 1960s in the South,"" added Jean Gratien, an immigrant from Rwanda who volunteers with a group that provides English lessons, coffee and sandwiches to the day laborers.\nCHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS\nBergenfield is a suburb of 26,000 people located ten miles outside New York City. Whites are a slim majority of the borough\'s residents. Rapidly growing Asian and Hispanic populations have helped reverse decades of population decline in Bergenfield and the surrounding area while stoking the concerns of some locals about Bergen County\'s changing complexion.\n""You have a lot of the population that is really aging,"" explains Bonnie Strain, a resident in Dumont. ""A lot of these workers \xe2\x80\x94 the ones I spoke to the other day \xe2\x80\x94 are busy doing additions, updating in people\'s houses.""\nThe tense stand-off that has been unfolding on the edge of Bergenfield for much of the past decade is emblematic of national trends that have made smaller communities like this one central to the struggle over the future of the United States\' 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nSince the 1990s, new immigrants, often following jobs in construction and the food industry, have been settling in growing numbers in suburban cities and rural towns, as well as across the South and Southwest. The effect was jarring for many whites who were accustomed to living alongside people who looked and spoke like they did.\nWhen longtime anti-immigrant groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) used the post-9/11 backlash against foreigners to launch attacks on immigrants, their nativist rhetoric fell on fertile ground. In late 2005, House Republicans pushed legislation, known as the Sensenbrenner Bill, that would have made it a felony \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to a civil violation \xe2\x80\x94 to reside in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant or to hire or assist one. The draconian measure sparked a massive response from immigrant communities across the nation. In the spring of 2006, a rolling series of protests that culminated on May Day saw an estimated 3 to 5 million people take to the streets in over 160 cities and towns in the largest series of mass demonstrations in U.S. history.\nNATIVISM GOES LOCAL\nThe Sensenbrenner Bill was dropped, but the mass mobilizations of 2006 soon turned out to be a high water mark for the immigrant rights movement. A surge in military-style workplace and predawn home raids conducted under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security drove many undocumented immigrants back into the shadows.\nAs author Juan Gonz\xc3\xa1\xc2\x87lez writes in Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America, it was ""the most extensive government campaign of roundups and deportations since the days of Operation Wetback [in the 1950s]. Nearly 900,000 people were deported by ICE from 2006 to 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 nearly three times the number removed from 2001 to 2003.""\nFollowing the defeat of the Sensenbrenner Bill in 2006, and with the onset of the Great Recession, conservative towns and cities throughout the country \xe2\x80\x94 with the support of the Bush administration \xe2\x80\x94 began to activate 287(g), a program that trains and deputizes local police officers to act as immigration agents and create an immigration dragnet. Later, the Obama administration would implement a 50-state roll out of Secure Communities, a program that relies on biometric identification technology that allows local police to check the fingerprints of arrested persons against FBI and Homeland Security databases.\nOther localities pushed further. Just weeks after the 2006 May Day protests, anti-immigrant activists in San Bernardino, California, a suburb outside of Los Angeles, began a petition drive calling for a city ordinance to restrict the employment and housing options of undocumented immigrants. With help from FAIR, similarly worded ordinances began appearing in places like Hazelton, Pennsylvania, Valley Park, Missouri, Farmers Branch, Texas and Riverside, New Jersey \xe2\x80\x94 obscure towns and suburban cities with conservative local governments that had experienced sharp increases of new immigrants over the previous two decades.\nIn the same way that angry whites initiated local battles against mandatory school busing in the 1970s that provided fodder for a larger post-civil rights era backlash, this wave of local anti-immigrant initiatives had an outsized impact as Washington-based politicians raced to stay ahead of public support for stricter, more punitive policies.\nMeanwhile, in Bogota, New Jersey, five miles south of Bergenfield, conservative mayor Steve Lonegan hosted a town hall meeting at the height of the 2006 marches that featured speakers from UPA, New Jersey Citizens for Immigration Control, and a national official from FAIR. A petition drive in Bergenfield calling for a citywide vote on 287(g) subsequently failed to gain enough signatures. But in 2007, the New Jersey Attorney General issued a directive saying that local law enforcement should inquire about a person\'s immigration status upon arrest for a serious crime. The UPA\'s weekly effort to intimidate day laborers in Bergenfield that began shortly after the 2006 mass protests continues to this day. But it is something of an outlier now compared to 2010, when the extreme nativist movement saw its peak with 319 similar groups active around the country.\nSince then, says Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center, ""most of the energy that once animated the anti-immigrant movement... moved into the political mainstream, where Republicans and Tea Partiers have competed with one another to craft ever-harsher nativist laws."" These state and local laws and federal enforcement programs have defined immigration policy for the country. They shape the terms of the current debate over immigration reform in Congress.\n""I think it is important to recognize that protests and attacks on day laborers and the attempts, both legislative and grassroots, to limit their access to paying jobs is part of a larger effort to limit the ability for all immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to seek work,"" says Aaron Flanagan of the Center for New Community. ""It is a material manifestation of the doctrine of self-deportation, or attrition through enforcement.""\nSOLIDARITY IN ACTION\nIn 2007, a coalition of anti-racist, pro-immigrant and socialist groups from New Jersey and New York began to hold counter-protests against the UPA. At the time, spirited rallies of as many as 100 people took place.\n""When there are organizations that want to defend the rights of immigrants it gives me a great feeling that we are not alone, that there are people who are not racist, who are on our side. It is a great motivation to continue and persevere,"" says Raynaldo.\nUnfortunately, the momentum to support the day laborers has waned over the years while the UPA has continued its weekly protests. On March 2, nine members of the Independent Workers\' Movement, a New York City-based network of day laborers, domestic workers and street vendors, joined over 30 day laborers in Bergenfield in a lively protest against the continued presence of UPA.\nSuch events bolster the morale of embattled day laborers. They also send a message to area residents that immigrant bashing is misguided and not worthy of their support, which is why these kinds of visible solidarity actions need to become much more common. Day laborers in Bergenfield have also begun meeting with IWM and are organizing to finally end the harassment they face from UPA.\nThe counter-mobilization against immigrant rights feeds off fear and ignorance and is centered in state and local areas outside of urban strongholds like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. This often unfamiliar terrain, the home turf of anti-immigrant forces, is where immigrant rights supporters need to be going on the offensive and contesting right-wing narratives. Only by changing hearts and minds at the grassroots level and isolating far-right nativists can we begin to shift the political establishment\'s fixation away from punishment and toward a more humane approach to immigration reform.\nMarty Kirchner is a member of the Independent Workers\' Movement.\nFor more, see:\nShaping the U.S. of the\xc2\xa021st\xc2\xa0Century, by Juan\xc2\xa0Gonz\xc3\xa1lez\nDreaming Out Loud, by Michael\xc2\xa0Gould-Wartofsky\nFighting for a Place to Call Home, by Michael\xc2\xa0Gould-Wartofsky\nA Day Laborer Says, \xe2\x80\x98We Deserve the Chance to Become Full Members of the Society We Contribute to Every Day,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0by Robert Meneses\n'",b'\n',"b'April 30, 2013'","b'At stake in the immigration reform battle is what America will look like in the 21st century. It will decide who is in the country legitimately, and who will be legitimately allowed to come into the country over the next several decades.\nIt\'s not the first kind of battle of its kind. The most recent immigration reform bill, passed in 1986, wasn\'t fully comprehensive. And before that, there were huge immigration battles in the 1960s, in the 1920s and even further back in the 1880s.\nThe devil is always in the details when it comes to legislation. The bipartisan group working on the Senate bill \xe2\x80\x94 dubbed the ""Gang of Eight"" and comprising Democratic Senators Michael Bennet, Dick Durbin, Robert Menendez and Chuck Schumer, and as well as Republicans Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Marco Rubio \xe2\x80\x94 released their proposal on April 17. But no matter what we know so far about the proposal of the Gang of Eight, there will be a separate bill adopted in the House of Representatives. It will undoubtedly be far weaker than what the Gang of Eight came up with in the Senate, and those bills will then have to be reconciled and then signed into law by the president.\nThis is only the beginning of what will be a long process that will go on through the spring and summer and probably into the fall. What we now know about this so-called Senate compromise bill is that it\'s going to be heavy on border security. It will delay the process by which those who are undocumented in the country will be able to establish their legal status, and even citizenship, a minimum of 10 years. So in the first 10 years, there will be beefed-up border security, more requirements and more spending by the government, which already spends an already enormous sum \xe2\x80\x94 $17.9 billion was spent last year alone \xe2\x80\x94 on border security in the United States. And according to Congress, the border will have to be 100 percent under surveillance, and there will have to be triggers before anyone can then be moved onto permanent residency status \xe2\x80\x94 not citizenship.\nWhy are they holding that up by 10 years? The real reason is that Democrats and some of the proponents of immigration reform don\'t want the cost \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, of health insurance for those undocumented immigrants who gain permanent residency status \xe2\x80\x94 to scuttle whatever legislation comes forward. One of the things they don\'t want to admit is that because Congress only projects 10-year budgets, delaying for 10 years will temporarily bury any costs associated with immigration reform. That\'s why they\'re willing to accept an inordinately long period for the undocumented to become even permanent residents.\nThen, there\'s the question of when they will actually become citizens. The other dark secret about immigration reform is that two-thirds of all the undocumented in the United States come from one country: Mexico. It\'s been suggested that people go to the back of the line, but there are currently people in Mexico who have been waiting 20 years to be admitted into the country. It\'s the longest line in the world. Two-thirds of the undocumented would have to get to the back of a 20-year line to be admitted into the United States, and many undocumented Mexican immigrants may be waiting 25 or 30 years, unless the government also increases the country caps for countries that have the longest lines.\nThe other complex issue that\'s going to be in this bill is that of who gets to come into the country in the future and how. There will be three provisions for labor flow. One will be for farm workers and another will be for other unskilled workers, such as hotel and service workers. And then there will be a provision for those who come in with professional technical skills under what are called the H-1B visas. Each of these will have sharp increases in the number of people admitted.\nAs many as 200,000 people will be admitted in the low-skill categories and sponsored by their employers. But then the question becomes: If you\'re sponsored by an employer, do you have portability? In other words, if you come in sponsored by one employer, do have to stay with that employer in order to stay in the country, or can you move your visa from one employer to another? What kind of job protections will you have? What kind of minimum wages will you be subjected to? The same thing will apply for the farm workers.\nRight now there are about 85,000 people allowed into the country every year under professional, skilled or scientific visas, the H-1B workers. The business community and Silicon Valley want to eliminate all caps on these visas and bring in as many highly educated people as possible. They want to change American immigration policy from ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free,"" to ""Give me your well-educated, those who can afford to pay either to come to a graduate school in the United States to get a quick visa into the country for permanent status or who can just basically pay their way into the country,"" and so, ""Give me your affluent and your well-educated."" If the proposed Senate bill is any indication, they may get their wish: the bill lifts the current cap on H-1B visas to 110,000, and that number is permitted to rise to as high as 180,000 in future years; it also increases the number of STEM field exemptions from the cap to 25,000. The numbers that are decided on in the final bill will have a real impact on what future immigration flow into the country will look like.\nThere are also small side issues, such as the several thousand children that are now in foster care because their parents were deported. They are American citizens. When the final bill is signed, will their parents be allowed to come back into the country to reunite with them?\nThis immigration bill is not only about undocumented immigrants, but also about these other questions. The bill that\'s ultimately passed into law will determine the future composition of the United States in the 21st century.\nThis article was adapted from an April 11 appearance by the author on Democracy Now\xc2\xa0(democracynow.org).\n\xc2\xa0\nFear of the Foreigner: A Brief History of United States Immigration Legislation\nThe United States is a nation of immigrants, but federal immigration laws have frequently been marked by a deep ambivalence toward newer arrivals.\n1882 - The Immigration Act - The first comprehensive federal immigration law called for the return of convicts, \xe2\x80\x9cidiots,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clunatics\xe2\x80\x9d and persons unable to care for themselves to their countries of origin. The new federal system was funded by a tax of fifty cents on each immigrant. In the same year, Congress approved the Chinese Exclusion Act, which effectively ended Chinese immigration to the United States for 80 years.\n1891 - The Immigration Act - The 1891 Immigration Act amended the 1882 act to also exclude immigrants considered to be polygamists, to have contagious diseases, and those \xe2\x80\x9clikely to become a public charge.\xe2\x80\x9d It also called for the deportation of any immigrants who fit these categories within one year of their entry. A congressional report at the time concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cat least 50 percent of the criminals, insane and paupers of our largest cities \xe2\x80\xa6 are of foreign birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n1917 - Immigration Act - This law introduced for the first time a post-entry criminal conduct basis for deportation. It called for otherwise legal residents to be deported if they committed \xe2\x80\x9ca crime involving moral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d within five years of their arrival. The Supreme Court upheld this language in 1951, ruling that it is not \xe2\x80\x9cvoid for vagueness\xe2\x80\x9d and it remains in use.\n1921 - Emergency Quota Act - This was the first immigration law that established a quota system based on nationality. It limited immigrants who could be admitted from any country to 3 percent of the number of persons from that country living in the United States based on the 1910 census.\n1952 - The Immigration and Nationality Act - Passed at the height of the McCarthy Era, this measure organized immigration statutes under one section of law, and included harsh provisions that limited judicial review of deportation cases and eliminated many statutes of limitation for deportation. It was co-authored by Rep. Francis Walter, who argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthousands of criminals and subversive aliens are roaming our streets, a continuing threat to the safety of our people.\xe2\x80\x9d The House and Senate passed the bill overwhelmingly, but President Truman vetoed it as \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessarily severe.\xe2\x80\x9d His veto was overridden.\n1965 - The Immigration and Nationality Act - This measure signed into law by President Johnson abolished the old quota system for immigrants, but put in place a new quota of 120,000 for the Western Hemisphere. The new system generated a backlog of immigrants from Latin America that continues to this day.\n1986 - Immigration Reform and Control Act - This act created a requirement for employers to verify whether employees are authorized to work in the United States, and \xe2\x80\x9clegalized\xe2\x80\x9d almost 3 million people. In order to be eligible for amnesty, undocumented immigrants first had to turn themselves in for deportation proceedings.\n1996 - Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act - President Clinton signed into law the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). The new rules retroactively expanded the criminal grounds for deportation, created mandatory detention for many immigrants, and authorized more state and local law enforcement participation in immigration enforcement.\nAdapted from \xe2\x80\x9cDeportation Nation: A Timeline Of Immigrant Criminalization\xe2\x80\x9d by Ren\xc3\xa9e Feltz and Stokely Baksh, DeportationNation.org.\nFor more, see:\nDreaming Out Loud, by Michael Gould-Wartofsky\nFighting for a Place to Call Home, by Michael Gould-Wartofsky\nCulture Clash: Confronting Nativists in the Jersey Suburbs, by Marty Kirchner\nA Day Laborer Says, \xe2\x80\x98We Deserve the Chance to Become Full Members of the Society We Contribute to Every Day,\xe2\x80\x99 by Robert Meneses\n'",b'\n',"b'April 30, 2013'","b'When Barack Obama sent Congress his proposed annual budget on April 10, he became the first Democratic president to advocate cutting Social Security benefits. It was a momentous turning point for the Democratic Party, now controlled by a business and professional elite convinced that to survive as a brand, the party must serve as executioner of the social contract that created that brand to begin with.\nBut the story actually began earlier this year, when the Obama administration and congressional Democrats agreed to a deal that rescued the vast majority of the Bush tax cuts from imminent expiration and made them permanent. In return, they got a temporary extension of unemployment benefits, a two-month delay of sequestration and extension of child care and tuition tax credits. All quite nice, but small potatoes and nothing that Washington couldn\'t easily scuttle at some point in the near future.\nThe Republicans, by contrast, got something of inestimable value, something they had been fighting for a decade to consummate. Crucially, only nine of the 77 members of the House Progressive Caucus voted against the bill, encouraging the White House that it could go further and making clear to voters from working households that their ability to hold their alleged champions in line is fading.\nNow, it\'s happening again, via the president\'s budget. This time, the deal is for another $680 billion in revenues over 10 years, to be accomplished by limiting tax breaks. This is calculated to please Washington-Wall Street deficit hawks by raising Obama\'s 10-year deficit reduction total to $4.3 trillion. One ingredient is especially troubling \xe2\x80\x94 the ""chained CPI,"" a revised Consumer Price Index that would be used to calculate annual cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security, Medicare and other federal programs.\nTouted as a mere ""technical correction"" that would make benefits increases smaller but more accurate, in reality the chained CPI would begin the transition of Social Security from an earned benefit with broad public support to a welfare-type program that\'s far more vulnerable to future cuts.\nHIGH STAKES\nPolitically, the stakes are incredibly high. By beginning the process of redefining Social Security downward, the White House is proposing, quite literally, to surrender the Democratic Party\'s birthright \xe2\x80\x94 its stewardship of Social Security, the capstone of the New Deal and the foundation of working Americans\' party loyalty, or what remains of it.\nThe president\'s budget doesn\'t even prescribe a 50/50 split between spending cuts and tax increases \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s severely skewed toward spending cuts, and would worsen the cumulative effects of the last couple of years of Democratic budget concessions rather than easing them. According to Dean Baker\'s analysis at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the hit that the typical retiree would take from the application of the chained CPI would amount to 3 percent of their benefits over time, or some 2 percent of their total income, which is about 70 percent accounted for by Social Security. By contrast, the tax hikes included in the fiscal cliff deal would cost couples making a cushy $500,000 a year or more only 0.6 percent of their after-tax income.\nOn balance, then, Obama is calling for a greater sacrifice from those who can least afford it than from those who\'ve spent the last dozen years benefiting from a Bush-era tax-advantage windfall. This is not just unfair, it\'s playing with human lives. Social Security keeps some 21 million American out of poverty every year, but many of them eke out an existence just this side of destitution. One-third of Social Security recipients rely on the benefits it pays for 90% of their income, and even a few hundred dollars less per year \xe2\x80\x94 the ""modest"" reductions touted by the chained CPI\'s supporters \xe2\x80\x94 could result in malnutrition or homelessness.\nThe chained CPI erodes the principle that Social Security should provide an adequate income for the elderly. From now on, this will be something not to be honored, but finessed \xe2\x80\x94 a game that Washington today is all too prepared to play. As Salon.com\'s Blake Zeff reminds us,\nThe first cut to popular, essential programs is always the most difficult; once it\'s been done, and that toe is in the water, there\'s the concern that future reductions could be more easily achieved. That\'s why the symbolism of a Democratic president attaching his name to \xe2\x80\x94 and owning \xe2\x80\x94 the cuts is so controversial and worrying for liberals. How hard would it be for Republicans to push future cuts through, when this is now a mainstream Democratic policy?\n\nCHALLENGING THE ELITE\nHappily, chances are that Obama\'s attack on Social Security will go nowhere this year. Congressional Republicans are too savvy to risk their political capital on a comparatively small reduction in the program that could be used against them in the mid-term elections. They also enjoy the sight of Obama going it alone in a reckless attack on his own party\'s foundations \xe2\x80\x94 former Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean, who was instrumental in building the voter base that put Obama in the presidency in 2008, has mused openly that the White House budget might drive him out of the party.\nBut Obama has laid down a marker that other elite Democrats will pick up in the not-too-distant future. For those who want to end the three-decade political siege of Social Security and Medicare, expand them to meet the needs of a changing economy, and put government back in the business of breaking down racial, class, wealth, and gender barriers, the challenge isn\'t to persuade Obama to be more progressive, or even to elect progressive candidates. It\'s to reverse a long-term trend in government that goes back 40 years and that has proceeded regardless of the party in power.\nThe creation of Social Security was made possible in the 1930s by the existence of a political left that was actively engaged with the issue of retirement security. The Townsend movement for a guaranteed income for the over-65s, Huey Long\'s Share Our Wealth movement, not to mention lively communist and socialist movements with grassroots followings, were coming up with their own ideas, making it far easier for Washington to see social insurance for what it was \xe2\x80\x94 a middle-of-the-road response to the demand for some form of collective support against the innate violence of capitalism.\nIf Social Security is going to be saved from the chained CPI and any number of other destructive gimmicks, the tool that does the job will not be lawmakers\' ability to forge creative compromises, but the power of our imaginations to conceive of something better \xe2\x80\x94 something that puts a scare into those lawmakers. As Che Guevara said, ""Be reasonable. Demand the impossible."" Otherwise, all we\'ll ever get is another bad deal.\nEric Laursen is author of The People\'s Pension: The Struggle to Defend Social Security Since Reagan (AK Press).

Thanks to federal legislation like No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top, the future of teachers\' jobs and of whole schools can ride on the whether students fill in the bubbles on their answer sheets correctly. Now, students and parents across the country \xe2\x80\x94 in places like Florida, Illinois, Colorado and Washington State \xe2\x80\x94 are rejecting the exams. In April, hundreds of New York City students refused to sit for a battery of standardized tests. Thousands more across the state also opted out. One of their most vocal supporters has been Fordham professor Mark Naison, who reflects on the testing regime and the opposition it has sparked in this short essay:\nBy Mark Naison\nWhen I first got involved in education activism four years ago, I did so because elected officials in New York and around the nation were blaming public school teachers for problems that were not of their making. Under the mantle of ""school reform,"" they were trying to subject them to numbers-based ""accountability"" protocols that would squeeze the life out of teaching.\nI saw the best teachers I knew \xe2\x80\x94 those who were my former students and those with whom I worked on Bronx community history projects \xe2\x80\x94 feel as though they had become demonized and marginalized by people who had little real-life understanding of what their job entailed. Since they lacked the power to speak freely about what was happening to them, I felt it was my duty to speak on their behalf.\nFour years later, there is still just as much pain and rage among the nation\'s teachers. Now that I am publicly identified as a ""teachers advocate,\' I probably get four or five emails or Facebook messages a week from teachers around the nation describing the fear, stress, humiliation and erosion of professional autonomy they experience as student test scores become the major indicator of judging teacher effectiveness. It is because of such experiences that I have launched, with the support of United Opt Out, a Teachers Oral History Project that will allow teachers\' viewpoints on current education policies to be recorded and preserved\nBut in April, as I became involved with an Opt Out movement in New York State that has inspired thousands of families to demand that their children be allowed to sit out state tests, I have become even more appalled by what current school policies are doing to children. The stories I have heard from parents about their children\'s school experiences have been even more heartbreaking than those I hear from teachers. The flood of high stakes tests into the schools of New York State has not only turned instruction into test prep, making once eager youngsters hate going to school, but it has also produced anxiety attacks and stress-related disorders on a massive scale among students as young as 8 years old.\nAnd these stories are not confined to one demographic group. I have heard them from parents in small towns and inner cities, in middle-class urban neighborhoods and suburbs. Children are traumatized by the length of the tests, by the steadily growing difficulty of the material they contain and by the fact that their teachers jobs depend on how well they perform. And God forbid a student or a family should decide not to take the test! In more than few school districts, children who have chosen to opt out have been have been browbeaten, insulted, threatened with loss of extracurricular activities and access to honors programs, told they will never get into college, told they are jeopardizing their teachers\' jobs, told they will be responsible for lowering real estate values in their neighborhood, and, in a few instances, told they are unpatriotic and giving aid and comfort to terrorists!\nGiven what I have seen and heard last month from the parents of New York State, I respectfully suggest that we, as a nation, need a long period of soul-searching to examine whether the test-driven policies that are being imposed with breakneck speed in public schools are good for children. The two weeks of testing that the children of New York State endured in April comes perilously close reaching abusive proportions. A society that loves and values its children would not accept this as the norm.\nMark Naison is a Professor of African-American Studies and History at Fordham University and Director of Fordham\'s Urban Studies Program.

Institution-building can destroy the heart and spirit that led to the creation of an organizational form.\n18\xc2\xa0We need to make a structured, strategic, organized break with the Democratic Party as the central gathering point of progressive politics in the U.S. There should be, roughly speaking, a truly mass third party, but not one specifically focused on elections, led by working class people of color.\n19\xc2\xa0We need a labor federation that includes community-based worker center organizations on an equal basis to traditional labor unions.\n20\xc2\xa0Push for a 30-hour work week \xe2\x80\x93 both as a mass demand for everyone, and for our sector, so people can have time to do movement work outside their paid jobs, and have time to build the kind of strong families and communities we need.\nPolitical Education & Base-Building\n21\xc2\xa0The idea work needs to get done now, the sharp analysis, so our demands can be big enough to match the scale of the multiple crises we face. Otherwise the next upsurge could be around small demands.\n22\xc2\xa0We need to remember it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to wage solid strategic organizing campaigns. People become leftists because their consciousness shifts. That has to happen at a much broader level, in different sectors. Building people\xe2\x80\x99s political consciousness is a minimal requirement for ever winning.\n23\xc2\xa0In the Black community, we need a big push on international awareness, with exchanges to Palestine, etc. Historically, our international outlook has been at a much higher level.

The Right is organizing them around a racist set of ideas, there are millions of working people who are struggling, who are increasingly precarious and insecure, who can be won over to the Left.\n28\xc2\xa0We need to expand the movement\xe2\x80\x99s attention to organizing in places where there are demographic shifts such as the South and Southwest. Combined with our centers of progressive work on the coasts, plus the Upper Midwest, we will have the basis for a new bloc.\nCampaignS & Infrastructure\n29\xc2\xa0Climate justice is a unifying rallying call for people around the world.

Take Wal-Mart for instance, the largest private employer in the U.S. Fighting them could unite us.\n32\xc2\xa0Our base-building groups need to expand our tactics beyond run-of-the-mill, show up at city council, do a petition kind of actions. Occupy was inspiring there.\n33\xc2\xa0We need a TON more people ready to do direct action and nonviolent civil disobedience. We need to be more politically confrontational with the state, which is connected to our need to be more politically independent.\n34\xc2\xa0We need to identify ways not just to get foundations to better resource our work, but we need to more fundamentally identify ways to have democratic control of capital to finance our movements.\n35\xc2\xa0We need to build new leadership to take over our institutions. We need to strengthen how we\xe2\x80\x99re developing second-tier leadership.\n36\xc2\xa0We need to become more creative about resourcing our work outside of the foundation world. Tithing 1% of our personal and organizational resources to the Left should go to work that advances cross-sectoral movement-building and Left activities, especially work that takes strategic risks and would never be funded by foundations.\n37\xc2\xa0We need to figure out how to take advantage of new technologies that make messaging and reaching people cheaper and easier.\n38\xc2\xa0We need to dramatically scale up our new media and communications capacity.

William Blake had previously moved Shelley\xe2\x80\x99s promise toward potential realization when, in 1804, he pledged that with unidentified comrades, we \xe2\x80\x9cwill not cease from mental fight nor let the sword sleep in our hands ... until we build ... Jerusalem in Britain\xe2\x80\x99s green and pleasant Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe job of the Left is to bring this promise to fruition. Today, New York City is the site of the greatest income inequality in the United States. In 2012, the top one percent garnered almost 40 percent of the total income generated by the entire economy of the richest city in the world. Sadly, at the moment of its greatest relevance, the Left has failed in both the United States and Europe to advance a program or the means for its fulfillment. While the people are demanding a way out of this deadlocked misery, the Left offers vacuous slogans, elaborations on democratic procedures and clumsy political pageantry.\nThe essential weapons at the Left\xe2\x80\x99s disposal are an understanding of history and a capability to build organizations. These are intrinsically connected pursuits.\nKarl Marx awakened millions by affirming, \xe2\x80\x9cThe [written] history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle. ... [It has been] an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMarx\xe2\x80\x99s reading of history enabled him to see that the oppressed, even when they constituted nearly 90 percent of the population, were unable to reconstitute their societies until the advent of capitalism. Concurrent with the mines and the dark, satanic mills, capitalism created a new class: wage workers, men and women who crowded into cities with swelling populations to work in enterprises with larger and larger numbers of employees. These wage workers had the unprecedented opportunity to become aware of themselves as a class and the possibility of radically changing society. Based on necessity, they organized to fight for their collective rights, which had genuine potential for positive outcomes.\nThe period of history from the founding of The First International in 1864 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 represents an epoch of stupendous achievement for the working classes and oppressed peoples of the entire world. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 established a state dedicated to building socialism, the Soviet Union began to industrialize and implement universal education. Based on the leadership of the Communist Party, millions of people, with little or no experience in running governments or building economies, formed a society where disparities of wealth were minimal, unemployment was unknown and education, medicine, public transportation, culture, rent and utilities were free or of nominal cost. Outside the Socialist Bloc, mass socialist and Communist parties vied with liberal and conservative parties, and often with each other, for political power.\nCommunist Party USA, Revisited\nThe achievements of the Communist Party USA (CP), whose membership never exceeded 100,000, were remarkable and, in many respects, are still instructive. The CP built organizations that led movements that responded to the actual, urgent needs of the Party\xe2\x80\x99s member and supporters as well as the enormous constituencies it intended to enlist in the wider struggle.\nCuriously, because of the drastic decline of the industrial working class, the experience of the CP\xe2\x80\x99s greatest success, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, may be the least relevant to present conditions. The creation, from the ground up, of industrial unions, where membership (unlike trade unions which organized only workers of a particular craft) included all workers of an industry, brought together in the same organization African- Americans, immigrants and women with the relatively privileged \xe2\x80\x9cold-stock,\xe2\x80\x9d white male workers. In CIO-organized factories, not only were the workers\xe2\x80\x99 wages much higher than those that prevailed among nonunion workers, the disparities in the wages of unskilled to highly skilled workers were far smaller. The CP played a key role in organizing the Steel Workers\xe2\x80\x99 and the Automobile Workers\xe2\x80\x99 unions. The twelve CP-led CIO unions, with nearly one million members, were expelled from the CIO in 1949.\nLess well-known, less-studied CP-led organizations have more immediate meaning to the rebuilding of a Left today. From its founding in 1925, the International Labor Defense (ILD) employed a dual strategy: It provided outstanding legal counsel while launching mass movements with as wide a reach as possible to victims of class and race oppression. Successes included the internationalization of the campaign to save Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, the freeing of \xe2\x80\x9clabor martyr\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Moony, saving the Scottsboro Boys and the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s overturning the conviction of Angelo Herndon, an African-American Communist organizer accused of insurrection.\nFighting for Immigrant Rights\nThe American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born (ACPFB), founded in 1923, provided legal aid to foreign-born Americans who faced deportation due to their political affiliations and activities. Simultaneously, it assisted immigrants in obtaining citizenship, mobilized public opinion on legislation affecting the foreign born and engendered sentiment for a multicultural United States.\nThe International Workers Order (IWO), a fraternal benefit society founded by the Party in 1930, organized into one \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, English-speaking) and fourteen \xe2\x80\x9cnationality\xe2\x80\x9d sections, offered low-cost term-life, burial and disability insurance policies while promoting cultural programs and first-language learning. The IWO\xe2\x80\x99s membership peaked in 1947 at 185,000 men and women organized into over two thousand lodges. The IWO functioned to finance the Party\xe2\x80\x99s foreign-language press, which reached a circulation of 400,000 in 1944. While drawing its members away from the Americanizing commercial culture, the IWO drew its members into the wider political Left under the slogan \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans All.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn 1944, a Left coalition dominated by the CP gained the leadership of the American Labor Party (ALP), which on average garnered 15 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s vote. The ALP ensured the election of Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia to his second and third terms and the reelections of East Harlem\xe2\x80\x99s Vito Marcantonio, the ALP\xe2\x80\x99s sole member in the House of Representatives. There he functioned as an eloquent, tireless spokesperson for the American Left; in 1950, he cast the sole vote against U.S. intervention in the Korean Civil War.\nThe Benefits of Coordination\nThe CP\xe2\x80\x93led and \xe2\x80\x93influenced organizations shared a common political outlook and culture: Their individual missions were viewed as fulfilling the longer-range goal of challenging capitalism itself. These organizations, while advocating for wider changes, provided some means for immediate relief. CP-style politics gave opportunities for activists, many of whom had limited education, to develop talents and skills that empowered them in their political work and their lives. Emblematic of all CP-led organizations was its inclusion of African-Americans and other minorities in their leadership and a socialization of whites to discourage attitudes of white chauvinism, that is, the pervasive sense of entitlement and superiority characteristic among many on the Left.\nThe influence of each organization was multiplied by the coordination of their efforts: IWO lodges served as meeting places for the CIO organization drives; the IWO could reach deeply into nationality communities where many, fearful of the consequences of membership, willingly contributed and participated in the Party\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns. In turn, the Party adopted a cultural pluralistic modus operandi. An excellent example of the coordination of these organizations to achieve an overarching goal was their mobilization to ensure Marcantonio\xe2\x80\x99s election. The CP-led New York City General Labor Council, the foreign-language press and the general resources of the ALP were concentrated on sending Marc back to Washington.\nThere is much to learn from this history, but history is not a cookbook from which we select favorite recipes. We must draw inspiration and leads which have the potential of producing tangible gains for the people, while struggling for wider, longer-lasting remedies. We must go to the people, not as missionaries but as junior partners with skills and comradeship. We must build trust among ourselves that is based on actions. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get started down a path that offers genuine hope of success. This is a life\xe2\x80\x99s work for a life worth living.\nGerald Meyer is a professor of history at Hostos Community College (CUNY).

I mean I waited. Every week or so, I take the train to Penn Station, quickly zigzagging through crowds. And every time I have the same internal monologue \xe2\x80\x94 Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop at the Krispy Kreme. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give yourself diabetes. Seriously, you might as well inject Elmer\xe2\x80\x99s glue straight into your heart. But then I saw the store, bright and beautiful and smelling good. It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to walk past Krispy Kreme. It\xe2\x80\x99s like those dreams where my legs move but I don\xe2\x80\x99t go forward.\nAnd then I begin the junkie\xe2\x80\x99s debate \xe2\x80\x94 C\xe2\x80\x99mon it\xe2\x80\x99s been three months! Besides, one can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt. And didn\xe2\x80\x99t I help that homeless lady get her shit to the shelter last night. That was an Oprah thing to do. And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Oprah eat donuts? I was drooling before I even turned. Everyone on line had the same wild look. I feared for the servers. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get us the donuts quickly we might have smashed the glass. When I got mine and bit into it, sugar and preservatives and trans-fat flooded my body and I lit up like a Christmas tree. It felt like Jesus descended from Heaven and kissed my brain.\nAfterwards I felt dirty, guilty. At home, I googled Krispy Kreme and found a YouTube clip of comedian Chris Rock prowling the stage. \xe2\x80\x9cKrispy Kreme donuts are so good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I told you it had crack in it you\xe2\x80\x99d go, \xe2\x80\x98I knew something was up \xe2\x80\xa6 got me knocking on the donut window at two in the morning. C\xe2\x80\x99mon man open up, give me one more donut, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything. I\xe2\x80\x99ll suck your dick.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nRock chuckled maniacally as the audience roared. I paused the clip and let it sink in. How much of what we eat is not really food but a drug designed to addict us with a rush of sugar, salt or fat? McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, Checkers and the other fried fast-food places line the streets in Bed-Stuy. Neighbors have that addict\xe2\x80\x99s scratch-the-neck gesture at bodegas where they buy sugary drinks or candy. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just food. How many times do I check my cell phone? I get itchy if I don\xe2\x80\x99t send or get a text. How many people do I see on the street, heads down, typing away, swerving around the traffic as if by radar?\nIn New York, we bounce like billiard balls between ads showing actors posing with a titanium watch and rappers with liquor bottles and sand-caked, teen bodies next to perfume vials. All the time, I see people waddling out of stores with bulging shopping bags, faces bright with the joy of a new purchase. Flush faces are the tell-tale sign of a dopamine rush. We get high from buying commodities that enhance our status. In this light, we can look at corporate stores and see them as consumer crack houses. If it\xe2\x80\x99s true that billions of people around the world are being addicted to our evolutionary Achille\xe2\x80\x99s heel of salt, sugar, fat and status, then it\xe2\x80\x99s time to ask the question. Are we capitalism junkies?\nThe Commodity\nA commodity in classical political economy is any object that can be bought or sold in the marketplace. The market is any institution or place where we can engage in trade, be it Wall Street or the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s stall at Union Square. From the market\xe2\x80\x99s beginning 12,000 years ago with the Neolithic Revolution, when we first cultivated land, grew crops, and created surplus and trade to the post-industrial digital stock exchange, it has grown to dominate human life.\nToday everything around us \xe2\x80\x94 clothing, apartments, food and technology \xe2\x80\x94 is a commodity. We wear commodities. We live inside commodities. We use and eat commodities. All that we need to live is filtered through the market. And if the store shelves are packed with bright colorful things, we feel safe because we have the freedom to choose.\nThe commodity has for centuries been the site of critique. In political economy it was an article of trade that satisfies a human need. Later it was reinterpreted by Karl Marx in Das Kapital as a fetish object concealing the exploitative relations of production. More than a century later, post-structuralist Jean Baudrillard redefined it as a sign in a larger social code.\nToday, a view emerging from neuroscience understands capitalism as an immersive form of market totalitarianism. We see that advertising and commodities are designed to get us to a \xe2\x80\x9cbliss point,\xe2\x80\x9d to stoke a chemical blaze in our brains that incrementally robs us of the ability to choose. And this is the paradox; American culture is based on the ideal of freedom \xe2\x80\x94 freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom to choose \xe2\x80\x94 but its economy is increasingly based on targeting the unconscious and addicting our bodies. Corporations use science to ensnare deep evolutionary impulses. We are left with a tragic contradiction; the very act of consumption that we are taught is our freedom is also what most enslaves us.\nBehold the iPhone\nMy cell phone was old. No touch screen. No internet. My friends would whip out smartphones and get precise, Googlemapped directions to the next bar. I took mine out, pretended to type an address and confidently offered random bullshit names like The Thirsty Wolf or Chug.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait why can\xe2\x80\x99t I see those?\xe2\x80\x9d one friend asked me. I quickly put my phone away, \xe2\x80\x9cOh damn, battery just ran out. Sorry. So what did you find?\xe2\x80\x9d But I was content with my Flintstone-era cell phone until one day it broke. After one hour without a text or the ability to send one, I began to shake and sweat. I sprinted to the Virgin Mobile store, where the staff calmed me down, gave me water, patted my back.\nIn seconds, I was holding my future phone. But I saw it four different ways. The first was a symbol of the American Dream, a set of ideals that put prosperity and upward mobility at the center of our lives. Smartphone commercials make it into a tool of consumer empowerment. No one and nothing is out of reach.\nThrough a Marxist lens, I saw the swollen-eyed, arthritic Chinese workers at Foxconn, which if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make Virgin Mobile smartphones, made them for Apple and made them in the millions. In the Marxist tradition this human labor is eclipsed by the object\xe2\x80\x99s transformation into a commodity through market exchange. We see its price tag or advertisement but not the people who made it or the fact that so many killed themselves by jumping off the roof of Foxconn that the company hung up nets.\nSeen through Baurdrillard\xe2\x80\x99s theory, my smartphone was a sign in a larger social code that recreated my identity. It was not simply a way to talk to friends. It was a smartphone. I now had instant access to information and was re-booted as a modern man. No asking directions or standing in line for a ticket at a cinema. Now I could do it all before I got there. Smartphone ads play on the theme of being up to date. One showed a trio of guys at a sports game: the ones with the 4G smartphones knew it was going to rain while the one with the 3G did not; he was doused when thunder broke. Today, commodities come with a story line and are the material anchors for the social roles we play.\nTurning my new phone over and over in my hand, I remembered that itchy feeling when my phone ran out of energy or when it was broken. Turning it on, I googled addiction, smartphones and lo and behold, I found a painfully in-your-face article titled \xe2\x80\x9cWhy We\xe2\x80\x99re All Addicted to Texts, Twitter and Google.\xe2\x80\x9d It spelled out why I slept with my phone at night like a teddy bear. Written by Dr. Susan Weinschenk and based on research by Terrence Robinson and Kent Berridge, the article said our brains squirt dopamine not to make us feel pleasure (a concept still used but debated) but to make us seek it out.\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter; it carries signals from neurons through synapses to other neurons or cells. Like Halle Berry in Monster\xe2\x80\x99s Ball, it \xe2\x80\x9cmakes me feel good.\xe2\x80\x9d It lights up the brain. It gets us moving toward satisfying goals. Weinschenk writes, \xe2\x80\x9cDopamine causes you to want, desire and search \xe2\x80\xa6 From an evolutionary standpoint this is critical. Dopamine keeps you motivated to move through your world, learn and survive. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about physical needs such as food or sex, but also about abstract concepts. Dopamine makes you curious about ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the scholarly article \xe2\x80\x9cAddiction,\xe2\x80\x9d Berridge and Robinson state that there are two systems in the brain, one that involves dopamine based on wanting and the other based on liking, the opioid system, which gives us pleasure. The former says, \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d The latter says, \xe2\x80\x9cStop and enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d But with social media, we now live in a culture where the \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d light is always green. In seconds we can text, Facebook, Google or call and get rewarded, which incites us to seek again, which rewards us again, causing us to seek again and be trapped in a dopamine loop.\nThe saddest image of the article was of dying rats. Scientists destroyed the dopamine neurons in rats and they died of starvation, even when food was right in front of them. They lost \xe2\x80\x9cthe will to live\xe2\x80\x9d or the chemical base of \xe2\x80\x9cwill power,\xe2\x80\x9d aka dopamine. In another test, scientists electrically stimulated the brains of lab animals to produce dopamine. Rats furiously, feverishly pressed the lever to tingle themselves more and more, faster and faster, because the dopamine system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an off switch.\nAfter reading this I walked around Union Square and studied the consumers flowing in and out of the stores. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on you rats,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cGet your cheese!\xe2\x80\x9d And this is what capitalism has made of us. We\xe2\x80\x99re a herd of slightly evolved primates gobbling salt, sugar, fat and status. We buy objects that light up our brains with dopamine even if we throw those same things away or incur debt. Using my new Chinese-made smartphone, I punched up Jay-Z\xe2\x80\x99s song \xe2\x80\x9cBig Pimpin\xe2\x80\x9d and bobbed my head, his nasal voice the soundtrack to thousands of New Yorkers shopping. \xe2\x80\x9cBig pimpin,\xe2\x80\x9d he rapped, \xe2\x80\x9cSpending cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Cheeto in the Crack Pipe\nGoing home on the B52 bus, I saw a father feeding his infant daughter bright, yellow, puffy Cheetos. I wanted to smack it out of his hand and yell, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is crack! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you just put the Cheetos in a pipe and have her smoke it?\xe2\x80\x9d But I closed my mouth and rolled my eyes instead.\nThe baby grabbed the Cheetos and I imagined the Yellow 6 dye that makes it day-glow food entering her blood. In laboratory tests, it caused kidney tumors and contained carcinogens. Good job, Dad! She licked her lips because the hydrogenated oil makes the Cheetos so tasty. If she grows up eating snacks like these, her heart will eventually become a wheezing accordion.\nMy stop came and I stepped off the bus, seeing as if for the first time the many fast-food places and bodegas lining Nostrand Avenue. They are the two major institutions in working-class urban neighborhoods. Over 200,000 fast food restaurants open their doors each morning in America. Sometimes it seems all of them are in Bed-Stuy.\nEach institution has a goal and the fast food industry is designed not to nourish bodies but to make profits. What was a $6 billion industry in 1970 raked in $160 billion last year. It did this by playing on our evolutionary buttons. Salt, sugar, fat \xe2\x80\x94 over the course of millions of years our bodies evolved to crave these tastes because it signaled the presence of much-needed nutrients.\nWe are physiologically adapted to survive famine. Our primeval ancestors roaming the high grass of the ancient savannah often had to endure hunger. Some hunters did not always have the best aim with the spear. Feast and famine marked us. We inherited a craving for fat, salt or sugar, and when any of them hits our tongues, our brain\xe2\x80\x99s opioid system goes off like fireworks and the dopamine begins to flow. It is our gastronomical weak spot, one that the modern food industry has targeted. Our bodies are garbage cans to dump junk into as long as it makes profit.\nThis February, the New York Times ran an article with a disturbing scene. Entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Extraordinary Science of Addictive Food,\xe2\x80\x9d it opened with a meeting of the 11 heads of America\xe2\x80\x99s major food corporations. The vice president of Kraft told attendees that the industry had gone too far in producing foods that excite hunger and overwhelm the body\xe2\x80\x99s controls on overeating. He cited statistics showing more than half of Americans were overweight and nearly one-quarter were obese. The head of General Mills, Stephen Sanger, got up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me about nutrition. Talk to me about taste, and if this stuff tastes better, don\xe2\x80\x99t run around trying to sell stuff that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t taste good.\xe2\x80\x9d The meeting took place in 1999. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 35.7 percent of Americans are overweight, along with one third of our children.\nWalking home, I often see obese women like giant water balloons, out of breath just from walking. Children, faces swollen with fat, throw candy on the counter at the local bodega. Every day, thousands of people in my neighborhood get breakfast, lunch and dinner from fast-food places or bodegas. Eating well takes time and money. And when you have neither, you get what you can. And here food is fast. It\xe2\x80\x99s cheap. It\xe2\x80\x99s addictive. And it\xe2\x80\x99s deadly. Not long ago, I saw an ambulance outside the adjacent building; my neighbor said his friend had died. He shook his head and said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe was 50, only 50, and caught a heart attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Nag Factor\nCapitalism \xe2\x80\x94 the private ownership over the means of production. It is the world of labor behind every smartphone, every Cheeto, every commodity. It is the factory and the workers inside. It is the bosses, regional managers and owners rising above the masses of workers in a vast pyramid of power.\nDefenders of the system say that it raises incomes and life-spans and serves the needs of consumers. But in a dialectical reversal, we can point at clear evidence that capitalism does not serve our needs but creates consumers to serve its need of making profit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a global conveyor belt where raw material is transformed into commodities, shipped to markets to be sold. But consumers are not born but made.\nWhile waiting for my laundry to dry, I heard a kid screaming at his mother for Lucky Charms. I mean this kid was hollering like an N.F.L. coach. His veins bulged at his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cMa, get me the Charms,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Charms! The Lucky Charms!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked haggard and took him outside and when they came back he was scooping the cereal into his mouth.\nThe nagging scene struck a memory. Once home, I looked up a documentary called The Corporation; in it, Lucy Hughes, Vice President of Initiative Media and co-creator of the report \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nag Factor,\xe2\x80\x9d said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe asked parents to keep a diary and to record every time a child nagged them for a product. Anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of purchases would not have occurred unless the child nagged their parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe had the smug smile of someone paid well enough to not care. Later Professor Susan Linn of Baker\xe2\x80\x99s Children Center said the study was done by corporations to get children to nag for their products. Linn was sad eyed. It was like she stared at the face of a juggernaut of money and power that she could analyze but not stop. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cChildren are not little adults. Marketers are playing into their development vulnerabilities. The advertising that children are exposed to today is honed by psychologists and enhanced by media technology.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLater Hughes reappeared, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can manipulate consumers into wanting and buying your products. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game.\xe2\x80\x9d Again that smug smile, she concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cThey are tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s adult consumer, so start talking with them now\xe2\x80\xa6and you got them as an adult. Someone asked me, \xe2\x80\x98Lucy is that ethical? You\xe2\x80\x99re essentially manipulating children.\xe2\x80\x99 Is it ethical, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but our mission at Initiative is to move product.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo move product \xe2\x80\x94 into the bodies of children even at risk to their health and by targeting their soft minds. How can one talk of freedom of choice when corporations target us before we have the ability to choose at all? The advertising bullseye hovers on us through our lives. As adults, it is our unconscious minds that are hit. Brand names are stitched on clothes, products are placed in movies. Images are slipped under our consciousness and descend into our psychic depths were they grow into decisions that we mistake for our own free will.\nCapitalism \xe2\x80\x94 this system of private ownership of the means of production rose from the collapse of feudalism, under which armored nobility in castles and cloaked monks in monasteries ruled over ragged peasants. It spread in the artisan towns and city states of the late Middle Ages, it spread with the enclosure of land as serfs, hungry and desperate, moved to factory work in the cities, it spread overseas in the New World conquest, the slave trade and colonization, it spread around the earth in violent racist colonialism. And now it dominates human civilization and has spread into our childhoods, our dreams and seeks to determine the destiny of our species.\nThe Body versus Capitalism\nOne of the most famous scenes in recent film history was from The Matrix, when the protagonist Neo is offered a red pill by a terrorist named Morpheus. He takes it and after plunging down a surreal dream wakes up hooked to cables in a gooey pod. He looks around and sees billions of pods with people sleeping inside.\nIt resonated because we experience Capitalism as turning our bodies against us. It is a parasitical system that feeds on us. It takes our tongues and blinds us with taste. It floods our unconscious with logos. It takes our desire and puts a price tag on it. And dizzy with sensation and directed by commercials, we work ourselves numb to become landfills for commodities.\nIs this the destiny of our species? Is this the highest we can imagine, the enslavement of millions to work making products and enslaving millions more to buy them? It seems the tragedy of our civilization is that by being walled in with commodities, we lose sight of how rare and precious we truly are.\nOur ability to create, to be conscious, to imagine is a spark of beauty in the void. Humanity is the result of a series of near improbable accidents. It is a sheer accident that we exist at all, that billions of years ago, hot rock formed a planet at this distance from the sun, that ice-loaded meteors hit earth and gave it water, that in the sea microbes ignited into life and plants swept over land.\nWhen visiting the Museum of Natural History, I imagine the T-Rex skeleton chomping up one or two visitors in a swift bite. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to feel how lucky we got with that comet impact 66 million years ago. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. It\xe2\x80\x99s an accident we\xe2\x80\x99re here at all.\nAnd yet here we are. The universe may teem with life but most likely it is microbes on rocks or germs in seas. Sentient life that looks up and questions is infinitely rare. Our ability to look far into space and deep into the atom, to follow the trail of elements to the origin of reality and to know its end, is incredibly precious. We, so far as we know, are the only species that is the living memory of the universe.\nThe human body \xe2\x80\x94 lulled into commodity addiction, brainwashed by advertising is itself evidence of the grand-narrative of evolution that surpasses capitalism. Over millions of years, natural selection sculpted us to fit the environment until we began to adapt the environment to fit our needs. Now we are trapped in an economic system that does not serve us but ensnares us to serve it. But the history of revolutions and art and crime show us a truth about ourselves. Our power to imagine is greater than our need to obey.\nNeuro-justice\nFreedom: 1. The absence of constraint on choice or action. 2. The liberation from slavery or from the power of another.\nThis is the land of the free and the home of the brave. Hey, buddy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a free country, right? In clich\xc3\xa9 sayings, we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded that freedom is our social ideal. In the iconic scenes of U.S. history we learn that our nation\xe2\x80\x99s flag was planted on the moon by an astronaut, our armies can strike anywhere, anytime, and even a black man can become president of a country that once had slavery.\nBut the daily evidence of that freedom is on the stacked store shelves and in the advertisements that teach us about the capitalist Good Life. But what if on either side of the commodity existed millions of people who were not free at all?\nWhat if we saw that behind the label is a world of misery? There, suicidal men and women grind their lives against a factory clock to make our low-cost clothing and technology. They see no exit but death and leap from the roof to the only freedom left to claim. There, undocumented workers pick tomatoes and staff the blood-soaked killing floors of meat factories to get us our cheap fast food.\nAnd in front of the label is us \xe2\x80\x94 people whose unconscious is shaped by subliminal advertising, our need for intimacy and recognition commodified into market experiences of bought and sold emotional labor. Our bodies are given addictive products that make us crave self-destruction. We who live in a market-dominated world are not free, but are chemically enslaved by the very sophisticated science of corporate America.\nA step we can take in freeing ourselves is critiquing capitalism differently. To the older frame of political economy focused on production, distribution and consumption of commodities we must add a new frame. One possibility is thinking in terms of a physiological economy, in which the body is transformed into a consuming machine and directed to the market where it\xe2\x80\x99s a commodity dumping ground, regardless of the health effects on it. Putting the body at the center creates a goal of respecting human potential.\nAnd what might help is the idea of neuro-justice as a New Millennial update on natural rights. We have as human beings a right to develop ourselves. We are inheritors of a cosmic accident that created the earth in the seething, plasma-hot, shooting gallery of space. We are inheritors of millions of years of evolution, and each of us belongs to a thing rare and precious in the universe, sentient life.\nBehind our eyes, in our brains is a power greater than reality. It\xe2\x80\x99s the power to imagine. A truly human civilization will move beyond capitalism, beyond addicting our consciousness to demanding space for it, play for it, love and recognition for it \xe2\x80\x94 it will demand justice for the imagination. In that world, we can walk home and see no corporate ads or stores with addictive foods or feel itchy for the newest technology or desperate for status. We can be free by simply being ourselves.\n'",b'\n',b'06/13/2013 - 12:09pm',"b'nice article, just scratches the surface, consumer addiction is eating the planet, destroying social institutions, de-evolving the mind..awareness is the first step...\n'",b'06/19/2013 - 3:57pm',b'Thanx or the mind food\n',b'06/23/2013 - 12:48pm',"b'Great article.

A veteran of three decades of social justice activism dating back to her childhood roots in the black working class of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Lee spent the past year interviewing 158 fellow left activists and organizers across the United States about their work and the hopes they had for seeing a \xe2\x80\x9cmovement of movements\xe2\x80\x9d emerge that could effectively challenge business as usual in this country. Lee and Williams recently released their first report (More Than We Imagined: Activists\xe2\x80\x99 Assessments on the Moment & The Way Forward), which provides a candid snapshot of how those who are fighting social justice every day perceive the challenges facing them.\nJohn Tarleton: Many people on the Left are discouraged at this moment, yet your report strikes a hopeful note. Why is that?\nNTanya Lee: I came out of the interviews sobered by people\xe2\x80\x99s assessments of the weaknesses of our movements and the challenges we need to overcome. Yet, in those same sobering conversations, people were so hungry, so ready to take the conditions of these times and be more bold with their work and do their work in different ways. Even though people weren\xe2\x80\x99t clear which way to go or on an overall strategy to strengthen our movements, that internal courage and readiness and hunger is essential to be able to move and people have that all over the country.\nJT: What do you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cmovement\xe2\x80\x9d? How is that different from having a collection of individual groups each pursuing their own campaigns?\nNL: For us, a movement exists where there\xe2\x80\x99s sustained, ongoing activism of many different forces working toward a common goal around shared values. From our perspective, there are actually many movements in the United States that are happening. The work in front of us is not to grow one big movement, but to build a movement of many movements.\nJT: In the eyes of the activists and organizers you spoke with, what are some of the fundamental challenges that they face?\nNL: One of the most common things people talked about was the level of fragmentation. In the United States, for a variety of historical and political reasons, social justice workers are really isolated from each other. They are all in these different silos fragmented by racial identity groups, constituency, etc. This is a core weakness but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the underlying weakness. The underlying weakness is a lack of coherent politics. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a coherent set of ideas that brings all our political work together, and that is what leads to fragmentation.\nThe other thing a lot of people talked about was how \xe2\x80\x9cmovement culture makes hard work harder.\xe2\x80\x9d People and organizations who are doing really good work for justice are sort of infested by dominant values like competitiveness, ambitiousness and ego-drive work and people with insecurities end up manifesting interpersonal rivalries that are very destructive. We are calling for a renewal of culture that goes back to some feminist values that have been lost in a lot of social justice organizations, where there\xe2\x80\x99s a real belief that how you do the work together matters.\nJT: You raise the issue of race a lot in your report. Why must a racial analysis be central to left movements?\nNL: Capitalism is racialized and white supremacy is embedded into the structure of it. The experience of working people differs depending on how they are racialized in this society. Our show they\xe2\x80\x99re positioned in our society. Also, we want to have people in leadership of a transformative movement who have the most at stake in changing and overturning the current system.\nJT: Many of the people you spoke with are active in base-building organizations. Can you describe what you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cbase building\xe2\x80\x9d and why it is important?\nNL: By base building, we mean doing membership recruitment, leadership development and campaign work to build organized bases of poor, usually working class people who can identify their own issues, their own campaigns and make demands that meet their own demands. There\xe2\x80\x99s no social movement in the history of the world that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t rested ultimately on local, organized bases of people as a core to moving things forward.\nJT: Why do people stick with social justice work? It\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy path to be on.\nNL: People are not in it for the money, clearly. One thing I would pull out is that people need a community of people who share their values and who are going to consistently support the work you are doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to be doing activist work and protesting and working on campaigns. We have to be really building relationships of trust with each other so that we can be with each other through hard and good times. Ultimately, we say, the movement should be \xe2\x80\x9cmagnetic.\xe2\x80\x9d The work should be the kind of work that makes people feel good and want to stay in. It should be hard work. It should involve personal sacrifice, as most work does. But if we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build a new kind of society as we do our work, the work should be fulfilling. And part of what makes it fulfilling is that we care about each other.\nJT: What does it mean to be a leftist as opposed to being a liberal? The media often blurs the two.\nNL: To be on the Left is to be explicitly anti-capitalist and to oppose the forms of oppression that are embedded within capitalism like white supremacy and patriarchy. People who are opposed to those systems and are seeking a society that replaces them are who I consider to be on the Left. Many people who consider themselves liberal want to improve the current system so there\xe2\x80\x99s less poverty perhaps, but are basically fine with the current economic system.\nMany of the people we interviewed do reform work as liberals do, but they do it with a different purpose and in a different way, with the leadership of working class people for example. They do it with a movement-building orientation that isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about advancing short-term organizational interests. 65 percent of the people we heard from identified as anti-capitalist and most times they said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not speaking for my organization, I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking personally.\xe2\x80\x9d I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very significant that the personal politics of the individuals in the social justice sector are to the left of their organizations. And I think increasingly so.\nJT: Many of the people you and Steve spoke with hesitated to give their political beliefs a label. Why is that?\nNL: People\xe2\x80\x99s discomfort at identifying has more to do with the lack of meaningful labels to identify with. So many people said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m a socialist, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means in the 21st century.\xe2\x80\x9d People don\xe2\x80\x99t want to use labels that they\xe2\x80\x99re not sure what they mean right now in this period. People don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be boxed in and targeted but not be able to fully articulate and defend their own ideas. Ultimately this lack of clear alternatives on the Left is a structural problem, not an individual one.\nJT: The Left puts much of its energy into ameliorating the damage done by conservative policies while the Right continues to heavily invest in propagating its ideology and thus tilting the political terrain further it its favor. How do you get out of this dynamic?\nNL: We need a vision of an alternative society. We need to answer basic questions about the current conditions of experience and then we can develop a long-term strategy for change. When we have that kind of plan, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to make us feel powerful and in fact be powerful, and have the guts to do the kind of crazy things the right-wing does because they\xe2\x80\x99re just so unapologetic about their goals and policies. We too can be that unapologetic, but in a strategic way, and not mistake militancy for strategy.\nI see the readiness of people to act, but it was clear in going around the country and talking to people that our level of analysis is not deep enough. We\xe2\x80\x99re not ready. Groups of us have to get together and do that rigorous level of analysis that can produce a strategy that makes some damn sense.\nJT: What would winning look like?\nNL: We\xe2\x80\x99re only going to get economic justice in a new system after capitalism, but it\xe2\x80\x99s insufficient to replace it with a system that\xe2\x80\x99s just going to raise the standard of living. That to me is where the Left is coming from in the 21st century. We need a new society based on protagonism that values full and deep participation of everyday people. Radical democracy and full human development are the goals of winning. That\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately what we want.\nFor more, see:\n39 Exciting Ideas for the Left, by\xc2\xa0NTanya Lee and Steve Williams\nLooking to Build a Larger Movement,\xc2\xa0by\xc2\xa0Steve Williams\n'",b'\n',"b'June 10, 2013'","b'My parents used to say that I was born in the wrong decade. As survivors of the segregated South who had graduated from Spelman and Morehouse Colleges in 1964, they had witnessed the rise of one of world\xe2\x80\x99s great social movements. They now worried about their would-be revolutionary son growing up in the time of Reagan and reaction. Some nights, before going to sleep I wished that I had been alive in the 1960s.\nI became an organizer in 1992 after I finished college. For the next 20 years, I organized with homeless and low-income people for economic, racial and gender justice in San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 for five years with the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness and for the next fifteen with POWER (People Organized to Win Employment Rights), a community organization of working class African-American and Latino workers, tenants, students and transit riders that I co-founded in 1997. During my time at POWER, I had the opportunity to recruit new fighters in the movement and to meet other organizers and activists across the country through the different campaigns and alliances that we were a part of.\nThe time that I spent working at POWER included some of my proudest moments, but with the economic collapse of 2008, I sensed that the movement was missing historic opportunities to advance a liberatory agenda. I decided to leave my position at POWER to focus my energies on building a massive popular movement. This was August 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 three weeks before Occupy Wall Street began.\nInspired by the experiences of the great African revolutionary Am\xc3\xadlcar Cabral who used his experience as an agronomist to strengthen the national liberation movement in Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau, I dreamed of interviewing organizers and activists from across the country about their insights and experiences on the frontlines of struggles for justice, sustainability and dignity. Now that I was unemployed, nothing was holding me back. After discussing the idea with another recently unemployed San Francisco organizer, NTanya Lee, the Ear to the Ground Project was born.\nListening Closely\nThe two of us set out to interview at least 150 organizers and activists. From the beginning, we knew that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to talk to all of the amazing organizers and activists doing important work in the United States. In fact, we were scared that few people would be interested in a project such as this; we only hoped that the people we asked would be polite enough to grant us an interview.\nSome of the people that we interviewed I knew from work we had done together in local organizing campaigns or national alliance work. Some I considered comrades, and others didn\xe2\x80\x99t know well but was interested in their assessments. But the interviews that were most powerful were those with people I was meeting for the first time. I was repeatedly surprised and humbled by the trust and generosity that people showed me \xe2\x80\x94 not only with their honest reflections but also by inviting me into their homes and sharing food with me.\nThis experience has changed me in many ways. I listen better now. The idea of the Ear to the Ground project always drew from the notion that all good organizing begins with listening, but amidst the pressures of day-to-day campaign work, I recognized my tendency to connect people\xe2\x80\x99s comments to my pre-existing ideas. Months of asking the same questions to some of the most thoughtful people in the movement with no pressure to emerge with an answer taught me the creative potential of spacious listening. I like to think that my assessments and recommendations are stronger now because I took in the richness of others\xe2\x80\x99 thinking.\nI had predicted that we would be inspired by the gritty and determined work that is happening across the country, and we were not disappointed. The imaginativeness driving so much important work is inspiring, but we were still left with the question of what it might take to bring the different strands of these efforts together into a larger whole. Given the difficulty that I\xe2\x80\x99d witnessed in developing shared work in local, statewide and national spaces, I expected widely different assessments to emerge from the interviews, but I was surprised by the consensus that emerged. The people we interviewed shared remarkably common assessments of the state of the world and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the movement.\nA Shared Desire\nCoupled with this, an overwhelming number of people we interviewed talked about their desire to shift the way that their work is being done. They want connection to a larger movement. They want to feel engaged in a project to change the world for the better \xe2\x80\x94 even if that means abandoning some of the institutions and identities that have gotten us to this point. Repeatedly, people talked about wanting to feel like they are a part of a team \xe2\x80\x94 just like me.\nWe began this project because it filled a need that NTanya and I felt, but over the course of almost a year and dozens of interviews, I see we weren\xe2\x80\x99t alone. We would often receive emails and phone calls from people in Detroit, New York, Atlanta, Albuquerque and Los Angeles asking us about how the project was coming along. Frankly, we were surprised, but this was a need that many of us felt. This interest pushed us to be more rigorous in writing More than We Imagined, which summarizes our findings from the interviews.\nNTanya and I traveled to more than 30 different communities across the United States to interview 158 organizers and activists, three-fourths of whom came of age after the political movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Clearly, there are a lot of people that we missed, and NTanya and I have started to joke about what it might mean to do a second round of interviews. We\xe2\x80\x99re not rushing into that right now because we really want to hear people\xe2\x80\x99s reactions and thoughts to this report of the first round.\nIn the end, I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful for this last year because it\xe2\x80\x99s shown me that if I were given a choice, this is the moment of history that I\xe2\x80\x99d choose to be alive and active. I\xe2\x80\x99d choose this time because I see that there are hundreds, if not tens of thousands of people out there, longing and dreaming and working for a world based on solidarity, liberation and sustainability. I see that I am not alone. After doing finishing this phase of the Ear to the Ground project, I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a community that I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to be a part of and that there\xe2\x80\x99s more of us than I ever imagined.\nFor more, see:\nOvercoming Fragmentation, interview of\xc2\xa0NTanya Lee by John Tarleton\n39 Exciting Ideas for the Left, by\xc2\xa0NTanya Lee and Steve Williams\n'",b'\n',b'07/07/2013 - 9:41pm',b'all i have to say is good for the both of you. keep up the good work! you really are never to old to learn new ways\n',"b'June 10, 2013'","b'Ninety-five degree temperatures did not deter hundreds of protesters from marching in the blazing sun at Ft. Meade, Md., on June 1 to support WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning. \xe2\x80\x9cAny day that we are out on the streets for justice is a good day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ashley McCauley, one of the protesters.\nThe rally and march took place two days before the beginning of Manning\xe2\x80\x99s trial on June 3. Participants included three busloads of people from New York City, members of organizations such as Veterans For Peace, Iraq Veterans Against the War, CODEPINK and Courage to Resist, and others that came from around the country in support of Manning.\nThe 25-year-old Manning faces 22 charges. He is accused of releasing nearly a million classified documents, including diplomatic cables, army reports on Iraq and Afghanistan and the notorious \xe2\x80\x9cCollateral Murder\xe2\x80\x9d video showing U.S. soldiers shooting unarmed civilians in Iraq in 2007. The trial is expected to take more than two months, with more than 100 witnesses scheduled; 24 of these are secret and will testify behind closed doors.\nManning does not deny leaking the documents and has already pled guilty to 10 of the lesser charges, but maintains that he released the information because he believed it was important for the public to know, saying in online chats that he hoped to start a debate on U.S. foreign policy.\nThe most serious charge he faces is that of aiding the enemy. In pretrial hearings, the prosecution contended that merely releasing the documents constituted guilt, a framework that Bradley Manning Support Committee steering committee member Kevin Zeese characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cvery dangerous for the media.\xe2\x80\x9d The judge rejected this, but also denied the defense\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the prosecution had to prove that Manning intended to \xe2\x80\x9caid the enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d instead saying that the knowledge that releasing the documents would \xe2\x80\x9caid the enemy\xe2\x80\x9d was sufficient to prove guilt.\nManning has gotten strong support from antiwar veterans. At the pre-march rally on June 1, Veterans For Peace member Ward Reilly said to the crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cBradley Manning\xe2\x80\x99s duty was to report what we reported. If you tell the truth in this country, you go to prison. \xe2\x80\xa6 Bradley Manning should never have been in Iraq to begin with to see what he saw, and that is our collective failure, to not control the politicians and the war criminals. It is our job to see that those war criminals go to jail and take Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s place.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHeather Linebaugh, a former Air Force drone intelligence analyst, also spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI did the same intelligence analysis as Bradley Manning. I saw the horrors of war and the needless killing every day that I served. I saw the lies that we tell people every day. I saw what really happens in war, the unjustified killings, because officers tell the enlisted: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re ordered to do, shut the hell up and do your job.\xe2\x80\x99 If we tried to talk about it, if we tried to tell someone else about it, we were told, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, collateral damage happens. You just have to accept it.\xe2\x80\x99 We treat Bradley Manning as a criminal, when he really woke us up to something that happens every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe asked for support for the whistleblowing community, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of other intelligence people in this country and abroad right now that would love to tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s really happening, but we\xe2\x80\x99re terrorized that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to let anyone know the true horrors of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the war. I ask all of you to just wake up to what\xe2\x80\x99s really happening, because the drone program is not a joke. There are people behind those drones being forced to kill people for illegitimate reasons. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a killing machine robot. It\xe2\x80\x99s a war.

The teachers said the test was unreliable and a waste of students\xe2\x80\x99 time. With strong support from parents and students, the boycott soon spread to other Seattle schools and sparked anti-testing actions across the country. On May 13, Seattle teachers heard the news they had been waiting for.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigh schools may opt out of MAP in 2013-14.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis message was in an all-district communication blast, sent at 2:06pm on Monday, May 13 by Seattle Public School Superintendent Jose Banda, and led to spontaneous end-of-day celebrations by teachers and students around Garfield High School. Students fist-bumping teachers. Teachers high-fiving each other. Ad hoc assemblies in the hallway to congratulate each other.\nUntil now, the \xe2\x80\x9cMeasures of Academic Progress\xe2\x80\x9d (MAP) tests were required by the Seattle School District for all students in grades K through 12. A unified group of Garfield teachers announced in January that they would no longer administer the tests to students at Garfield. Other Seattle schools followed suit, and the bravery of these teachers led to a national movement.\nWhy were Garfield teachers celebrating the discontinuing of the MAP for our students next year?\nWe celebrated because we know hundreds of hours of student time will no longer be wasted on a test the district has now acknowledged is inappropriate for our students.\nWe celebrated because our English Language Learner students will no longer be humiliated by taking a test that is not culturally or linguistically appropriate and they will now have more hours to spend on the additional instructional time they need.\nWe celebrated because our special education students will not have to fidget in their chairs when they strike a computer key for the MAP test that never accounted for the student\xe2\x80\x99s individualized education plans.\nWe celebrated because our students will no longer have to stare at the dull glow of a computer screen as they contemplate what possible answers they could give to questions on material that was never part of their state-mandated curriculum.\nWe celebrated because our evaluations would not be tied to test scores generated by bored students who have no motivation to perform well on possibly their fifth standardized test of the year. Annoyed students have been known to select \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d for each and every answer on that silly test.\nWe celebrated because we still have jobs we love, and because our superintendent had to back off of his original threat to suspend teachers for ten days without pay for refusing to administer an ill-conceived test (for which the district spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year).\nWe celebrated because teaches, parents and students across the country (from Austin to Boston) and around the world (from New Zealand to England) have been inspired by our resistance and are waging their own battles for quality assessment.\nPerhaps most of all, we were celebrating because we are building a collaborative spirit of faculty and student solidarity at Garfield. Our students know we have their best interests at heart, and that the power of our commitment to truth can overcome the powerful.\nYet while teachers at five of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s high schools (Chief Sealth, Center School, Ballard, Ingraham and Garfield) who joined the MAP boycott are elated by the news of this victory, Superintendent Banda\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail also warned that students in kindergarten through eighth grade will still be required to take the test next year.\nOur victory, then, remains incomplete. Faculty at ORCA (K\xe2\x80\x935) and Thornton Creek Elementary have raised equally powerful arguments about the flawed use of the test at the primary grade levels. Moreover, the Department of Education released results from its 2012 study, showing the MAP to be ineffective at improving reading levels for students in the fourth and fifth grades. Similarly, the Chicago school district recently announced it was suspending the MAP for grades K\xe2\x80\x935 \xe2\x80\x94 a clear indication the MAP isn\xe2\x80\x99t serving the youngest pupils either.\nFor these reasons, Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s high school teachers will continue to join with our K-8 colleagues to call on the Seattle School District to terminate its contract with the MAP test company at the end of this school year (when the agreement expires). The key to the victory over the high school MAP test was solidarity and widespread public support, and we intend to carry these lessons forward to change policy for K-8 schools as well.\nAs we both continue to build the movement to scrap the MAP and celebrate our huge victory, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget the answer to this year\xe2\x80\x99s end-of-semester exam: if we stand for what\xe2\x80\x99s right for students, teachers can win.\nJesse Hagopian is a public high school teacher in Seattle and a founding member of Social Equality Educators (SEE).

On June 28 he addressed attendees of the Socialism 2013 conference in Chicago via Skype. Here is a lightly edited excerpt of his talk.\nI want to spend a little bit of time describing what has happened to me over the last four weeks from a somewhat personal perspective. It was many months ago that I was first contacted by Edward Snowden. He contacted me by email. He was anonymous. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much. He simply said he had what he thought would be some documents that I\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in looking at, which turned out to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest understatement of the decade.\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until he was in Hong Kong that we really began to have substantive online conversations about who he was, what he was doing and what kind of documents he had. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know his name. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything biographical about him, his age, where even he worked.\nLike most of us do when we\xe2\x80\x99re interacting with somebody exclusively online, I began to form a mental impression of who he was. And I was pretty certain that he was older, even in his sixties. I thought that because he had such obviously penetrating access to top-secret documents. He also had such incredibly sophisticated and well-thought-through insight into the nature of the national security apparatus and his own relationship to it, that I thought he had been thinking about these things and interacting with them for decades.\nBut the real reason I thought that he was that age, nearing retirement, nearing even the end of his life, was because he was very emphatic from the beginning that he absolutely knew what he was doing would essentially unravel and probably destroy his life. That the chances that he would end up in prison for the rest of his life, if not worse, were very high. Probably close to inevitable. Or that at the very least that he would be on the run from the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful state for the rest of his life.\nWhen I got to Hong Kong and met him for the first time, I was more disoriented than I think I had ever been in my life. Not only was he not 65, but he was 29 and looked much younger. When the filmmaker Laura Poitras and I went to his hotel room and began questioning him, what I really wanted to understand was what led him to make this extraordinary choice. This was in part because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be part of an event that would destroy somebody\xe2\x80\x99s life if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t completely open-eyed and rational about the decision that they were making. But it was also because I wanted to understand what would lead somebody with their entire life in front of them \xe2\x80\x94 a perfectly desirable life: living with his longtime girlfriend in Hawaii, with career stability, a reasonably well-paying job \xe2\x80\x94 to throw it all away, become an instant fugitive and probably spend the rest of their life in a cage.\nThe more I spoke with him about it, the more I understood. And the more I understood, the more overwhelmed I became. What he told me over and over in different ways \xe2\x80\x94 and it was so pure and passionate that I never doubted its authenticity for even a moment \xe2\x80\x94 was that there\xe2\x80\x99s more to life than material comfort. Or career stability. Or trying to simply prolong your life as long as possible. What he continuously told me was that he judged his life not by the things that he thought about himself, but by the actions that he took in pursuit of those beliefs.\nWhen I asked him how he got to the point where he was willing to take that risk, he told me that for a long time he had been looking for a leader, somebody who would come and fix these problems. And then one day he realized that there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in waiting for a leader, that leadership is about going first and setting an example for others. And what he ultimately said is that he simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live in a world where the U.S. government was permitted to engage in these extraordinary invasions, to build a system that had as its goal the destruction of all individual privacy. That he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to live in a world like that, and that he could not in good conscience stand by and allow that to happen knowing that he had the power to help stop it.\nBut the thing that was most striking to me about all of this is that I was with him for 11 straight days. I was with him before we divulged what his identity was, and I watched him watch the debates that he had really hoped to provoke unfold on CNN, NBC, MSNBC and every other channel around the world. I also watched him, once he was revealed, realize that he had become the most wanted man in the world. That Washington was calling for his head. And what was truly staggering to me, and continues to be staggering to me, is there was never a moment, never an iota, of remorse or regret or fear. This was an individual completely at peace with the choice that he had made because that choice was so incredibly powerful.\nI was incredibly inspired by being in proximity to somebody who had reached a state of such tranquility \xe2\x80\x94 because he was so convinced that what he had done was right. His courage and passion infected me to the point that I vowed that no matter what I did in my life, with this story and beyond, I would devote myself to doing justice to the incredible act of self-sacrifice that Edward Snowden had made.\nI then watched that energy infect everybody who I work with at The Guardian. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched, over the last several weeks, the editors of The Guardian engage in incredibly intrepid and fearless journalism and dismiss, day after day, the fear-mongering and threats of the U.S. government by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue publish whatever we think should be published in the public good.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne of the things that I know I set out to do, and that I think Mr. Snowden set out to do, and that I know the people at The Guardian set out to do, was not simply to publish some stories about the NSA. It was to really shake up the foundations of the corrupted and rotted roots of America\xe2\x80\x99s political and media culture.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an economist, Dean Baker, who wrote on Twitter that he thinks that the stories that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing are shining as much light on the corruption of American journalism as they are on the ongoing operations of the NSA. I think that is true, for several different reasons.\nNumber one is that if you look at the \xe2\x80\x9cdebate\xe2\x80\x9d over the about whether or not I should be arrested, prosecuted and then imprisoned under espionage statutes for doing journalism, what you find is that that debate is being led by people who are TV actors who play the role of journalists on TV. They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who are actually feeding the debate. They purport to be adversaries and watchdogs of political power, but they are actually servants of political power.\nWhat you find is that they always lead the way in attacking whoever challenges the political system in Washington, because that is the system of which they\xe2\x80\x99re a part. That system props them up, gives them oxygen and provides them with all of their privilege, wealth and access. And their true role \xe2\x80\x94 not to serve as adversaries of people in government power or to expose what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but to protect and shield them, and amplify their message \xe2\x80\x94 has become more vividly exposed in the last several weeks than it has in quite a long time.\nWhen I look at how whistleblowers are treated, I can understand why ordinary Americans might have ambivalence about them. Some people think security is more important. Or that secrecy is something that should be decided by democratically elected officials and not by individual whistleblowers. But what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is how anybody who at any point thought of themselves as having a journalistic ethos would look at people who are shining light on the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful factions and do anything but applaud and express gratitude for them, since that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the function that they, the journalists, themselves are serving. And yet what you find is the exact opposite.\nGlenn Greenwald is the author of four books, including With Liberty and Justice for Some: How the Law is Used to Destroy Equality and Protect the Powerful.\nFor more surveillance state coverage, see:\nUnder the Gaze, by Nicholas Powers\nAs the NSA Follows You, We Follow the Money, by Emily Masters\nAvoiding Online Surveillance: Tips & Tricks, by Tactical Tech Team\nNew Poster Series: Edward Snowden, by Indy Staff\nFor a PDF version of this issue, click here.\n'",b'\n',"b'July 16, 2013'","b'Since the 9/11 attacks, the United States has witnessed the rapid growth of an intelligence-industrial complex that fuses government and corporate power. According to the Project on Government Oversight, $300 billion a year is now spent on a \xe2\x80\x9cshadow government of private contractors.\xe2\x80\x9d At the center of this arrangement is an interlocking web of current and former high-level government officials, major corporations, D.C. think tanks and other inside-the-Beltway operators who have benefitted from the rise of the surveillance state. Here are a few of the most notable:\nSen. Dianne Feinstein and Richard C. Blum: The Intelligence Power Couple\nLife must be good when you are deciding on government cyber-intelligence spending. But it must be even better if your husband is profiting handsomely off those decisions.\nDianne Feinstein (D-CA), the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, is married to Richard C. Blum, who was substantially invested in URS Corp, which owns EG&G, a leading government technical provider that has been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in security-related contracts. Feinstein never abstained from voting when it affected her husband\xe2\x80\x99s wallet and Blum made $100 million when he sold his shares, as investigative reporter Peter Byrne exposed in his 2007 series the \xe2\x80\x9cFeinstein Files.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRep. Mike Rogers: Taking Care of His Backers\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese narrowly targeted programs are legal, do not invade Americans\xe2\x80\x99 privacy, and are essential to detecting and disrupting future terrorist attacks,\xe2\x80\x9d Rep. Mike Rogers (R. - Mich.) wrote in a USA Today editorial. As chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he was asked to respond to the NSA leaks.\nWhat did his editorial leave out? That, of his top 20 contributors, Rogers received campaign financing from eight of the major private intelligence contractors along with over $100,000 from defense industry Political Action Committees (PACs) in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nRogers recently introduced legislation for the \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement and reauthorization\xe2\x80\x9d of the USA PATRIOT Act, the post-9/11 law that has been used to greatly expand the surveillance state.\nJohn M. \xe2\x80\x9cMike\xe2\x80\x9d McConnell: Making the Revolving Door Spin\nMike McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 reads like an advertisement for Washington\xe2\x80\x99s revolving door. In 1996, after four years as the NSA Director, he moved to Booz Allen Hamilton, a leading private intelligence contractor. McConnell was the Senior Vice President at Booz until 2006, when President George W. Bush added him to the cabinet as Director of National Intelligence. McConnell returned to Booz in 2009, becoming vice chairman and earning between $2 to $4 million a year, according to The New York Times. In a 2012 interview with the Times, he dismissed groups calling for greater privacy protections as \xe2\x80\x9cspecial interests.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMichael Chertoff: In Search of Opportunity\nMichael Chertoff certainly gets around. In 2001, he helped craft the PATRIOT Act while serving as Assistant Attorney General in the Bush Justice Department. After a stint as Secretary of Homeland Security (2005-2009), Chertoff co-founded the Chertoff Group, a consulting firm that, according to its website, \xe2\x80\x9chelps our clients identify new opportunities around the world to grow and invest in the security industry.\xe2\x80\x9d One of those \xe2\x80\x9cnew opportunities\xe2\x80\x9d turned out to be a multi-million dollar government contract for the controversial full-body airport scanners which were produced by OSI Systems, a client of the Chertoff Group.\nThe Intelligence and National Security Alliance: Trade Association for Spooks\nWashington, D.C. is rife with trade associations lobbying the government to shower favors on their member companies. For the intelligence industry, INSA is the go-to group that has played a key role in facilitating the outsourcing of government intelligence work to private companies. Past chairs of INSA\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Directors include Mike McConnell, former Director of National Intelligence (2006\xe2\x80\x932009) and CIA Director John Brennan, a key architect of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s expanded use of drones.\nNorthrop Grumman: Investing in Its Future\nNorthrop Grumman has made a pretty penny for its work focused on homeland security, as well as drones and naval vessels. According to Business Insider, the company made a total profit of $2 billion in 2012.\nThe United States\xe2\x80\x99 third largest military contractor, Northrop Grumman spent $17.5 million on lobbying in 2012. It also dished out an additional $4 million in campaign contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, bestowing donations of $10,000 or more on 98 members of Congress, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who received a $20,800 contribution.\nBooz Allen Hamilton: Connections Pay Off\nAs the privatization of U.S. intelligence advances, industry leaders like Booz Allen Hamilton are engaged directly in information gathering and providing analysis and advice to government officials, according to The New York Times. A-list names with ties to Booz Allen include James Clapper, the current Director of National Intelligence and a former Booz executive, and Mike McConnell, a former Director of National Intelligence and the company\xe2\x80\x99s current vice-chairman. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a business model. In June, the Times reported, \xe2\x80\x9cBooz Allen earned $1.3 billion, 23 percent of the company\xe2\x80\x99s total revenue, from intelligence work during its most recent fiscal year.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Heritage Foundation: Champion of Privatization\n\xe2\x80\x9cEfficiently tapping the private sector for national security can be an enormous competitive advantage for the U.S.,\xe2\x80\x9d James Carafano, Heritage VP, said on the foundation\xe2\x80\x99s blog.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s hardly shocking since this leading conservative foundation receives funding from five major military contractors, including Northrop Grumman, according to Heritage\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 annual report.\nThink tanks, often cited in the media, have the ear of both politicians and the public, which is why their funders take such a keen interest in their work.\nBrookings Institute: Promoting Bipartisan Consensus\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is little reason for all but a handful of Americans to lose sleep over [PRISM], and those most likely to lose sleep are also most likely to pose security threats.\xe2\x80\x9d No, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Heritage Foundation. That was a guest scholar at the Brookings Institute, a venerable D.C. think tank with deep ties to the Democratic Party and extensive corporate funding. Major donors to Brookings include Booz Allen Hamilton, which donated more than $1 million, according to the 2012 Brookings Annual Report. Brookings received $250,000 from Richard C. Blum and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Contributions of $25,000 to $100,000 each rolled in from Northrop Grumman and four other defense contractors. Blum also serves on the Board of Trustees with Vice Chair David M. Rubenstein, the Managing Director of The Carlyle Group, which owns Booz Allen.\nFor more surveillance state coverage, see:\nNew Poster Series: Edward Snowden, by Indy Staff\nGlenn Greenwald Reflects on Meeting Snowden, by Glenn Greenwald\nUnder the Gaze, by Nicholas Powers\nAvoiding Online Surveillance: Tips & Tricks, by Tactical Tech Team\nFor a PDF of this issue, click here.\n'",b'\n',b'07/23/2013 - 11:59am',"b'Keeping the people scared and profiting from it is a very old and lucrative business.

Akram Shah, a pharmacist, picked up his cousin Sherzada, a student; Atiq-ur-Rehman, another pharmacist; Ishrad Khan, a teenager; and Umar Khan, an auto mechanic. As they drove to a nearby village, the hiss of U.S. drone missiles filled the air. Explosions rocked the road. One hit the car and charred the men alive.\nMay 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 NYPD officers ordered Nicholas Peart, a 23-year-old Black college student against the wall. It was the fifth time in his life he\xe2\x80\x99d been stopped and frisked. They took his cellphone, keys and wallet, then handcuffed him and put him in the backseat. Later they released him.\nSummer 2010 \xe2\x80\x94 Alfred Carpenter was laid off in the Great Recession; he tore his knee and was out of work for a year. When he looked again for a job, even with six years of experience in his field, no one hired him. He told his friend of the mess his finances were in, he responded, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you got bad credit? They\xe2\x80\x99ll never hire you.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCorpses in a burning car, a man roughed up by cops, another denied work are scenes of Precrime \xe2\x80\x94 state and corporate strategies meant to deter crime or profit loss before it even happens. It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to be part of a group \xe2\x80\x94 a Muslim man in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s tribal areas, an urban Black male or a low credit score applicant to be identified as the source of trouble and targeted.\nPrecrime is a term created by Philip K. Dick in his 1956 short story Minority Report, made into a 2002 movie of the same name. In it a trio of \xe2\x80\x9cprecogs,\xe2\x80\x9d or mutant humans, float in a water tank seeing visions of future violence. After recording these dreams, the Precrime Division\xe2\x80\x99s paramilitary cops arrest people before they commit the crime.\nToday the role of the \xe2\x80\x9cprecogs\xe2\x80\x9d is being played by computer software that uses data mining to map social networks, purchasing behavior and movement patterns to predict who will commit acts of terrorism, local crime or job negligence. And the film\xe2\x80\x99s Precrime cops are in reality the military, police and employers who use physical force and legal discrimination to secure the future of the state and corporate profits.\nOnline, Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s Guilty\nIf you have any online life, you leave a digital trail. Send an e-mail, make a call, Google porn, swipe a credit card or open a Facebook account and it will be recorded. The information being data mined allows behavioral patterns to be extracted and character profiles to be compiled. And it is being done every second by corporations, political campaigns and government divisions like the National Security Agency.\nWhen Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the NSA, leaked documents to The Guardian newspaper, it exposed government data mining. In much the same way as universal gun registration terrified the Right, digital surveillance sent shudders through the Left. We saw in it the FBI tactics used against the anti-Vietnam War movement. We know elders who were hounded by COINTEL. We remember our own uneasy sleep under the police watchtowers at Occupy Wall Street.\nThe difference between past and present state surveillance is that today\xe2\x80\x99s federal and local law enforcement can use data mining of social network sites to disrupt protests before they form. Or if another terrorist attack shocks the nation or we go through a digital McCarthy era, the totality of our online lives can be used as evidence against us. Most importantly, innocence is no longer a state of being one can lose through an action but is instead a transition point on a life trajectory predicted by computer programs.\nBeyond political organizations are the nine million people who lost their jobs from 2008\xe2\x80\x99s Wall Street Crash who are now part of the 22 million underemployed and the 50 million in poverty. Employers are scanning Facebook pages, criminal records and credit scores to sift applicants. The longer someone is unemployed and the poorer one is, the more likely that person is to run up bad debt or get into legal trouble, which will show up in their digital trail. When they apply for jobs, the past is used against them. They leave the job interview, condemned to generational poverty because of their online profile.\nThe logic of empire, the logic of Jim Crow and the logic of class war structure the data mining strategies of governments and corporations. The predictive policing by law enforcement and drug testing, background checks and credit checks by corporations recreate the status quo of a hierarchical America teetering on the edge.\nSignature Strikes\nMarch 17, 2011 \xe2\x80\x94 Some forty men gathered at a bus depot in Datta Khel, Pakistan for a tribal meeting called a jirga. Drones circled the sky, but they had told the local Pakistani military about the meeting and thus weren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid. They were just there to settle a dispute over a mine. After settling in, a hissing sound filled their ears. An explosion blew them apart. The U.S. drone fired another missile, then another.\nAfterward, the shocked survivors scooped up the remains. The tally of the dead was forty-two. Most were government employees or tribal leaders, according to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism\xe2\x80\x99s report, \xe2\x80\x9cLiving Under Drones.\xe2\x80\x9d Only four were Taliban. Witness Idriss Farid said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey were pieces \xe2\x80\x94 body pieces \xe2\x80\x94 lying around.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the rough tribal areas, the sky is a source of terror. According to the report, from June 2004 to September 2012 \xe2\x80\x9cdrone strikes killed 2,562\xe2\x80\x933,325 people in Pakistan, of whom 474\xe2\x80\x93881 were civilians, including 176 children.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnder President Bush most were \xe2\x80\x9cpersonality strikes\xe2\x80\x9d on named, high-value targets linked to non-state terrorist organizations. Under President Obama the spectrum of targets was expanded to include \xe2\x80\x9csignature strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d attacks based on \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98pattern of life\xe2\x80\x99 analysis\xe2\x80\x9d that targets \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98groups of men who bear certain signatures, or defining characteristics associated with terrorist activity, but whose identities aren\xe2\x80\x99t known.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf you are an adult male in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s tribal areas, you are a suspect. If you carry a gun, go to a wedding or meeting and members of the Taliban are there, you are now by association a viable target. Your name, social networks and movements will enter the Disposition Matrix database. It is a program run by the National Counterterrorism Center, described by Glen Miller in The Washington Post as \xe2\x80\x9ca single, continually evolving database\xe2\x80\x9d that includes \xe2\x80\x9cbiographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrategies for taking targets down.\xe2\x80\x9d But, according to NBC News, from 2010 to 2011 the CIA could not confirm the identity of a quarter of those killed by drone strikes. Here is the foreign face of Precrime.\nPredictive Policing\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference whether the drone is up in the air or on the building,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on the John Gambling radio show. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re gonna have face-recognition software \xe2\x80\xa6 You can\xe2\x80\x99t keep the tides from coming in. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have more visibility and less privacy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you stop that.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDrones the size of small planes like the Houston Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s ScanEagle or drones the size of hummingbirds could fly through the city. Hovering near windows they could have night vision, zoom lenses, see-through imaging and face recognition software. Domestic drones have already joined wiretapping, street cameras and web surveillance in the arsenal of law enforcement. But what will be done with this information? As police departments are flooded with data, private corporations such as SAS Institute are pitching them programs to analyze it. In their white paper, \xe2\x80\x9cTwitter and Facebook Analysis; It\xe2\x80\x99s Not Just for Marketing Anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d SAS offers police the ability to gain entry into accounts, discover relationships, map social networks and collect individuals\xe2\x80\x99 data.\nSome programs aren\xe2\x80\x99t just to find current crime but instead predict future crime waves, much like weather forecasts. Current models like CompStat in New York rely on compiling data and, based on it, patrolling where crime has happened. Using PredPol, a program created initially to predict earthquake aftershocks, police will be sent to where crime will happen.\nAnd it works. San Diego, Seattle and Columbia, South Carolina are using PredPol and have seen burglary rates drop. But the website PrivacySOS makes the argument that predictive policing keeps in place the status quo of inequality. One example is that whites, Latinos and blacks smoke marijuana at roughly the same rate. But minorities are arrested nearly three times the rate of whites. Based on this data, predictive policing will come down harder on neighborhoods of color, justifying the cops\xe2\x80\x99 presence with the language of math.\nAccording to PrivacySOS, predictive policing just recreates \xe2\x80\x9cthe feedback loop of injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d in which urban men of color are stopped and frisked incessantly. It\xe2\x80\x99s a form of public shaming and punishment to be thrown against a wall and groped by cops. It\xe2\x80\x99s the face of domestic Precrime that Mayor Bloomberg endorses.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the New York Daily News. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where they went to school, but they certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a math course, or a logic course.\xe2\x80\x9d\nClass Warfare\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked for my Facebook password,\xe2\x80\x9d my mom said. My eyebrows lifted. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you give it to him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She had told the employer that she deactivated her account. It seemed odd, but asking around, I heard friends say that background checks, drug tests and credit score checks were normal practice. And sometimes, they cost people a chance at life. On March 4, Blake Ellis wrote in CNN Money that one in four Americans go through a credit check for a job and one in ten are denied a job because of it.\nBlacks and Latinos are more held back by this due to the deeply entrenched unemployment that pummels their credit scores. In June 2013, the African-American unemployment rate was 13.7 percent, Latinos 9.1 percent and whites 6.6 percent. So the members of communities hit hardest by unemployment have the hardest time getting a job. According to Ellis, citing a survey by the Society of Human Resources, companies screen credit scores to prevent theft, embezzlement or \xe2\x80\x9cnegligent hiring.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLow credit score applicants are not being punished for wrongs they did but ones they are expected to. And this is layered on older forms of institutional prejudice. In 2009, The New York Times reported on Black job applicants \xe2\x80\x98whitening\xe2\x80\x99 their r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s by changing their names, removing historically black colleges and selecting white references. Before doing so they did not get calls back for an interview.\nHere is the face of corporate Precrime. And, while those who are poor are poor for so long that they can\xe2\x80\x99t find a way into the workforce, Microsoft recently came up with a way to avoid them and their neighborhoods. In 2012, it issued a patent for an application that gives \xe2\x80\x98walking directions.\xe2\x80\x99 One of its features is computing the crime statistics of an area and directing the user around the bad neighborhoods. So, if they are ignored long enough, they just disappear.\nReversing the Dynamic\nWhat happens when all the networks are connected? When drug tests, Facebook and credit scores, drone footage, e-mail and Google history, and buying and movement patterns are integrated into a single profile for each citizen that is monitored by corporations and government? Will those with progressive politics or anti-authoritarian temperaments be tracked?\nThe more important question is how being watched and threatened with Precrime punishment changes our behavior. Even as cameras track us and each keystroke is recorded, it\xe2\x80\x99s the heavy feeling of judgment that kills us internally. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this before. In the racial paranoia of Jim Crow, the political fever of McCarthyism, the shame of poverty in today\xe2\x80\x99s Great Recession, it\xe2\x80\x99s the social ideal, the light by which we measure ourselves that casts a long shadow into our lives.\nHow do we cure ourselves of fear? How do we roll back the practice of Precrime? A recurring lesson of social movements is that we must reverse the surveillance dynamic. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting at segregated lunch counters, confronting pharmaceutical bureaucrats with H.I.V. victims or hauling sofas in front of Bank of America to make visible the foreclosure crisis, the goal of activists is to pierce the social distance between the privileged and the invisible victims of their power.\nWe on the Left create scenes of moral crisis by making pain visible. In doing so, those who suffered silently can create community and take meaningful action. And the action becomes a social mirror where the ruling class itself is seen as a criminal enterprise.\nA Leftist Supercomputer\nIn the film Minority Report, the plot turns on the possibility of the Precrime program going national. But it has one flaw. If someone knows the future, they can change it. At the climax, agent John Anderton confronts Lamar Burgess, the director of the Precrime Division who murdered people to keep this truth from going public. Standing, gun in hand, he is predicted to kill Anderton. If he does, the program is sound. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, the program is illegitimate and it ends. Burgess turns the gun on himself and shoots.\nThe film pivots on the idea that the future \xe2\x80\x94 the final outcome of our actions \xe2\x80\x94 is not determined if we see the consequences of our present. It is a choice denied to the millions caught in poverty, in war zones and in the social constructs of ethnic, gender or class categories. There, life feels like being caught in a flow of events one cannot control. There, life ends where the increasingly sophisticated programs predict it will, in death, jail or misery.\nBut like in Minority Report, we can change our future by not just following the predictions of the next crime but understanding that its source is often a larger, invisible, systemic crime. It\xe2\x80\x99s the basic divide between the Left and the Right. The Right sees social institutions as innately valuable for continuity and accepts hierarchy and inequality. We, the Left, see social hierarchy as innately destructive.\nSo what if we made a film called Majority Report, about a Leftist supercomputer named Lenin? In it, technicians in white suits would say that it is programmed to save the earth, end poverty and create the Good Life. Unlike predictive policing, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t target future crime but tally the world\xe2\x80\x99s data and solve the very source of crime.\nTall as a cathedral, it would hum with immense electricity as people around the world wait to hear what it said. In the film, drones would be reprogrammed to buzz the offices of Goldman Sachs. Police would receive orders on their phones to arrest Wall Street traders. Planned Parenthood clinics would find their checking accounts flush with cash. The wealthy would receive e-mails announcing new high taxes. Schools would be told to hire more teachers.\nAnd desperate to stop it, politicians and business leaders would try to yank the plug. Audiences would cheer as the film\xe2\x80\x99s heroes defend the supercomputer as it churns out new laws, new policies for a new world. The climax would be Lenin being blown up by a bomb planted by a conservative, and in the moment, the people of the world would hang suspended. And then they would realize it was too late. Having seen the source of crime and its solution, the people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need Lenin anymore and take over the cities because, finally, they\xe2\x80\x99d be free to choose their future.\nFor more surveillance state coverage, see:\nAs the NSA\xc2\xa0Follows You, We Follow the Money, by Emily Masters\nGlenn Greenwald Reflects on Meeting Snowden, by Glenn Greenwald\nNew Poster Series: Edward Snowden, by Indy Staff\nAvoiding Online Surveillance: Tips & Tricks, by Tactical Tech Team\nFor a PDF version of this issue, click here.\n'",b'\n',b'07/17/2013 - 5:15pm',"b'My recent reports on Trayvon, State Department and USA goal to reduce mankind to a fearful & trembling species.\nTrayvon, police state:\nhttp://www.indymedia.org.nz/articles/1029\nstate department:\nhttp://neworleans.indymedia.org/news/2013/07/18217.php\nSnowden plus information of this: fbi yells \'wolf\' (""mass murderer"") to turn poublic opinion against whistleblower:\nhttp://seekingalpha.com/instablog/436163-geral-sosbee/1992682-fbi-cia-ns...\nfearful, trembling:\nhttp://barcelona.indymedia.org/newswire/display/460988/index.php\ncollapse:\nhttp://lissakr11humane.com/2012/09/08/collapse-of-the-constitutional-gov...\n'","b'August 17, 2013'","b'Click here to see or download the second Indypendent Whistleblower Poster\xc2\xa0in full.\n\nDATE OF BIRTH \nAugust 9, 1964\nHOMETOWN\nNew Castle, Pennsylvania\nCAREER\nKiriakou served in the CIA from 1990 to 2004 as an analyst and a case officer.

The most serious charge against him \xe2\x80\x94 aiding the enemy \xe2\x80\x94 was dismissed, but Manning still faces up to 90 years in prison on counts that include espionage (despite the lack of evidence for intent to spy and the lack of evidence that his leaking ever did any real harm).\nThat his 2010 disclosure of hundreds of thousands of U.S. government documents changed the world is undeniable. Here are 10 of the most significant revelations they contained:\n1. Manning revealed the Collateral Murder video of a helicopter attack in Iraq on mostly unarmed noncombatants (though some of those struck may have been armed), including two Reuters journalists \xe2\x80\x94 whose cameras were taken for weapons \xe2\x80\x94 and children. The army maintains that the video does not show wrongdoing, but the killing of unarmed journalists is a war crime, and the callousness of the soldiers talking in the video gives an idea of what was going on in Iraq during the years of the U.S. occupation. When the Bush administration asked the Iraqi parliament for permission to keep a base in the country, the parliamentarians refused. The U.S. military was forced to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011.\n2. Manning exposed the full extent of the corruption of Tunisian dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, adding fuel to the youth protest movement of late 2010, which translated the relevant U.S. cables into Arabic. Manning contributed to the outbreak of powerful youth movements demanding more democratic governance in the Arab world.\n3. Manning revealed to the U.S. and Yemeni publics the secret drone war that Washington was waging in that country. That the cables show then-dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh acquiescing to the U.S. strikes on his country probably played into the movement to remove him as president, which succeeded in early 2012.\n4. He revealed that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered U.S. diplomats to spy on their United Nations counterparts. The U.N. spy requests included cables that demanded intelligence on U.N. leadership, foreshadowing later revelations of extensive U.S. spying on allies like Germany via the NSA.\n5. His leaks showed that then-Senator John Kerry pressed Israel to be open to returning the Golan Heights to Syria as part of a peace negotiation. This item suggests that Kerry might be more of an honest broker in the current negotiations than some observers give him credit for.\n6. Manning exposed overwhelming corruption in the Afghan government. This degree of corruption, which has shaken the whole banking system and caused U.S. funds to be massively misused, is still a factor in deciding whether to stay in Afghanistan in some capacity after December 2014. The U.S. public is in a better position to judge the issue with these documents available.\n7. Manning showed the degree of authoritarianism and corruption of the Egyptian government of Hosni Mubarak, which was subsequently swept away.\n8. Manning revealed that hard-nosed realist and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was against striking Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear enrichment facilities because it would slow their program down only slightly, but would inevitably cause Iranians to be angry and mobilized in the aftermath.\n9. Manning revealed that Israeli authorities had a secret plan to keep the Palestinian population of Gaza on the brink of food insecurity and poor health, in one of the creepiest military operations in history; one State Department cable read, \xe2\x80\x9cIsraeli officials have confirmed to Embassy officials on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n10. Manning\xe2\x80\x99s act of courage encouraged hackers to leak the emails of Bashar al-Assad and his wife, showing their jewelry purchases in Europe and gilded lifestyle while al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s artillery was pounding Homs and other cities with no regard for the lives of noncombatants. In fact, Manning inspired numerous leakers, including some who blew the whistle on PLO corruption and willingness to give away most of Jerusalem to Israel, and, likely, Edward Snowden, who revealed to us that our government has us all under surveillance.\nJuan Cole is a professor of history at the University of Michigan. An earlier version of this article was published on the author\xe2\x80\x99s blog, Informed Comment, at JuanCole.com.\n\xc2\xa0\nPrison on a Timeshare Plan\nWith Bradley Manning facing up to 90 years in prison, thousands of his supporters from around the world are asking to be able to serve part of his sentence. As The Indypendent went to press, more than 3,900 people had signed an online petition at Credoaction.com urging the U.S. Army general who oversaw Manning\xe2\x80\x99s military trial to allow them to do some of Manning\xe2\x80\x99s hard time.

Meanwhile, a hunger strike at Pelican Bay Prison in California for improved conditions, including an end to long-term solitary confinement, reached one month on August 8.\nAt Guant\xc3\xa1namo, nearly 40 prisoners are still being force-fed daily, a practice that the United Nations calls torture and the American Medical Association deems against medical ethics.\nOrganizing in solidarity with both hunger strikes has stepped up this summer. On June 26, 18 activists were arrested at the White House, including CODEPINK cofounder Diane Wilson, who capped off a 58-day water-only solidarity fast by climbing over the White House fence in order to demand that President Barack Obama make good on his campaign promise to close the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo. She faces up to six months in prison for unlawful entry. Currently two people are on a long-term fast \xe2\x80\x94 Cynthia Papermaster of CODEPINK and Andr\xc3\xa9s Thomas Conteris of closegitmo.net.\nTwo others ended their hunger strikes on August 4 at a mosque in Albany, NY, joining with that community for the daily iftar meal that ends the sunrise-to-sunset fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Former Veterans For Peace President Elliott Adams and VFP board member Tarak Kauff had been taking in less than 300 calories, Adams for 80 days and Kauff for 58.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men at Guant\xc3\xa1namo and Pelican Bay have undertaken a hunger strike because their situation has become so unbearable they are willing to do without one of the few things they have in life that are precious, which is food,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kauff.\nHe was among six people arrested inside the Hart Senate Building in Washington, D.C. on July 30 after a simulated force-feeding by members of CODEPINK outside the building. Seven activists carried posters with photos of prisoners from Pelican Bay and Guant\xc3\xa1namo and spoke from the balconies overlooking the large atrium, telling prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 stories in the first person and demanding freedom for the 86 men in Guant\xc3\xa1namo who have been cleared for release and an end to all long-term solitary confinement in U.S. prisons. On any given day, some 80,000-90,000 inmates in the United States are in solitary confinement, including some as young as 13 years old.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is happening in this country is completely wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Margaret Flowers, an organizer with popularresistance.org who was also arrested. \xe2\x80\x9cIt goes against medical advice; it goes against moral advice; it goes against U.N. conventions. We should not put children into jail at all. In particular they should not be put into solitary confinement. \xe2\x80\xa6 It ruins their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor more information, see closegitmo.net.\n'",b'\n',"b'August 17, 2013'","b'August 5, 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 While writing this, I hear gunshots. Soon a police helicopter circles the Louis Armstrong Projects next door; its spotlight sweeps their rooftops like a submarine inspecting an ocean floor.\nI turn off the lights so the shooter won\xe2\x80\x99t see me, move the curtain and study the roof where the gunfire echoed. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one there. Scanning the city beyond, I know mostly Black and Latino men are shooting or being shot.\nLightheaded with adrenaline, I close the curtain. In Bed-Stuy, the fear of violence never fades but throbs under the surface of everyday life. On my stoop, a young man was shot dead. His father sits there nearly every day, as if waiting for his son to return. Between the killings are random shots like tonight that send me peering through the window.\nMany of our young men are like open barrels of kerosene. One wrong look or word and they ignite into a blind fury that ends with death in the streets. And we who knew them, raised them, are also at times scared of them. And our fear is being turned against us because a whole outside world is also scared of them.\nWalking downstairs, I sit on the stoop, remembering how tense it gets during the annual block party when men from other neighborhoods show up drinking and smoking. Every year, a late-night fight breaks out and someone is thrown against the car and pummeled. The sad truth is that the way George Zimmerman profiled Trayvon Martin is the same way that many of us, men of color, profile each other.\nWhen I see conservatives on Fox News say Black and Latino men should be profiled, I know the difference is they are simply afraid of them while we, people of color, who are their family and friends, are also scared for them. We knew them as children. We know they were born with targets on their backs and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit from birth with abuse, neglect and racial slurs. And the buildup of pain finds its voice in the flash of a gun barrel. Each new crime means another Black or Latino face snarls under a headline of violence, which adds to the social prejudice that deepens their segregation, which creates more poverty, which becomes more crime, which feeds again the great fear. We are trapped in a cycle of violence.\nSitting on the stoop, I watch the police helicopter circle above. Its light sweeps the buildings, a small circle of visibility, searching in the darkness.\nThe Many Trayvons\nFebruary 26, 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 Neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman studied a young Black man wearing a hoodie in the rain, strolling through a Florida gated community. He called the police, who told him not to follow the young man. In the 911 call released later, a man can be heard screaming, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp,\xe2\x80\x9d and then a gunshot.\nTrayvon Martin lay bleeding in the grass. He was 17 years old. He was visiting his family in the gated community. He died with Skittles and an Arizona iced tea. He was young, Black and male; those three elements made him background noise in the daily toll of American violence. His family hired attorney Benjamin Crump and spread the news. On March 7 Reuters published a story: \xe2\x80\x9cFamily of Florida Boy Killed by Neighborhood Watch Seeks Arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d Rev. Al Sharpton took up the cause on his MSNBC show PoliticsNation. But what echoed in the minds of millions of people was the chilling scream for help, cut by a gunshot.\nAs media across the political spectrum reported his death, he multiplied into many Trayvons. Liberals and leftists saw him as a victim of racist profiling in which bigots project stereotypes onto people of color. It is common for minorities to be acutely aware of how the majority group sees us. Your life depends on it. Sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois called it \xe2\x80\x9cDouble-Consciousness\xe2\x80\x9d; it is, he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cthis sense of always looking at one\xe2\x80\x99s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one\xe2\x80\x99s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe image we see is the Ghetto Brute \xe2\x80\x94 an animalistic man of color who targets helpless whites. Life inside this image is dangerous. One can act on it in bitter pride or wear a safe mask for others even if it means not recognizing yourself in the mirror.\nAnd the Ghetto Brute image lands harder the further down we are in class and the browner we are in skin tone. In a nation of 313 million people are 39 million African-Americans. Of them, 10 million live in poverty. Those of us born too dark or too poor live under the weight of a stigma that shapes us from birth. It\xe2\x80\x99s why we rallied in the hundreds at Union Square for a Million Hoodie March, saying in unity, \xe2\x80\x9cI am Trayvon!\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe was a symbol for us because like Sean Bell or Amadou Diallo, both innocent, both killed by the NYPD, Martin\xe2\x80\x99s death gave us a sharp contrast between his innocence and the violence that killed him. It made visible the injustices we daily endure. Sharpton said on PoliticsNation, \xe2\x80\x9cTo many in the African-American community the killing of that teenager is emblematic of a grossly unjust system, of a thousand unequal steps, from stop and frisk to disproportionate drug laws to racially motivated sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOn the other side, conservatives saw Martin as a tragic victim of justified profiling. Zimmerman\xe2\x80\x99s perception was not, they say, caused by bigotry but the pathologies of Black culture itself that creates high crime rates and hence the association of young, Black men with criminality. A few said Blacks are animals that must be segregated. Whether one explained the source of the crime as Black pathology or biological inferiority, the blame was displaced from Zimmerman onto Martin and by extension onto Black America in its entirety.\nThe need to prove that Martin\xe2\x80\x99s murder was justified profiling drove Fox News, National Review and the Nazi site Stormfront to \xe2\x80\x9cblacken\xe2\x80\x9d Martin by critiquing his clothes and teen posturing. The day after the Million Hoodie March, Fox News pundit Geraldo Rivera blamed Martin\xe2\x80\x99s choice of wearing a hoodie: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see a kid walking down the street, particularly a dark skinned kid ... what\xe2\x80\x99s the instant association? It\xe2\x80\x99s those crime scene surveillance tapes, every time you see someone sticking up a 7/11 it\xe2\x80\x99s a kid in a hoodie.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRight-wing sites released photos of Martin smiling with a gold grill. Other photos showed him giving the finger, exhaling a mouthful of what could be pot smoke. His Twitter account, @NO LIMIT NIGGA, had bawdy adolescent rambling like, \xe2\x80\x9cHahaha hoe you got used fo yo loose ass pussy! Tighten up! #Literally!\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn March 2012, Twitchy.com used a photo assumed to be Martin standing with shorts sagging, flipping off the camera. It was not Martin but another Florida teen. They issued an apology but on Stormfront a forum member said, \xe2\x80\x9cGlad he\xe2\x80\x99s gone. One less welfare monkey breeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe goal was to make Martin look like a young Ghetto Brute who\xe2\x80\x99d commit real crime, implying it was good that he was removed now. This violent suspicion comes from a \xe2\x80\x9cSecurity Obsession\xe2\x80\x9d that sees life as \xe2\x80\x9csurvival of the fittest,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a political or racial majority must protect its purity and culture against encroaching minorities. It sees the Other as irredeemably different, unable to assimilate and ultimately a threat.\nIt is a long tradition of fear that has scarred history. We see this mindset in Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s Mein Kampf when he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cIn every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people\xe2\x80\x9d or Pat Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s The End of White America, \xe2\x80\x9cThose who believe the rise to power of an Obama rainbow coalition of peoples of color means the whites who helped to engineer it will steer it are deluding themselves. The whites may discover what it is like to ride in the back of the bus.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Security Obsession is translated into street-level racism by people like Sgt. Ron King of the Port Canaveral Police Department, who offered his colleagues \xe2\x80\x9cTrayvon Martin\xe2\x80\x9d paper shooting targets. It showed a dark hoodie, its sleeve holding Skittles and Arizona iced tea. They declined to use it. He was fired. But when a local reporter contacted the seller, he emailed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe response is overwhelming. I sold out in 2 days.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOf course before the liberal or conservative image of Trayvon Martin existed there was the young man, a real, living, human being. As the men at the shooting range fired bullet after bullet at the Martin target, Sybrina Fulton, his mother, was in court listening to a man scream for help in a 911 recording, then a gunshot. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Resurgence of White Supremacy\nJune 25, 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 A text beeped on my phone; it read, \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme Court just sent us back to the plantation.\xe2\x80\x9d It linked to a breaking story: conservative justices struck down as unconstitutional Section 4b of the 1965 Civil Rights Act, which forced states with a history of discrimination to clear changes in voting rules with the Department of Justice.\nShaking my head, I imagined Republicans rubbing their hands with glee, thinking about the voter suppression techniques they\xe2\x80\x99ll use in the next election. They want to choke off democracy to the rising tide of voters of color who are part of the \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition of the ascendant.\xe2\x80\x9d Sixty-six million voters, mostly youth, minorities and college-educated whites, in particular women, enabled President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second term. The resistance we get as the face of a changing nation is as old as the nation itself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hold these truths to be self-evident,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas Jefferson wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all men are created equal.\xe2\x80\x9d As the ink dried on the Declaration of Independence, African slaves toiled in the fields of his plantation. It was a great contradiction to demand freedom but own slaves. The Founding Fathers resolved it by defining \xe2\x80\x9cNegroes\xe2\x80\x9d as not human. When independence was won, a deep line was drawn between citizen and Other, the former were propertied white males and the latter, poor white males, women and non-whites.\nThe history of America is the great churning conflict between the ideal of democracy and the practice of racism, sexism and classism, each one driven by capitalism. Eventually, states dropped property requirements and all white males could vote. But it was a \xe2\x80\x9cwhiteness\xe2\x80\x9d seen most clearly against the backdrop of blackness.\nThe struggle between white supremacy and democracy waxed and waned. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, Black people pushed out of the South into the West, Midwest and North. In the cities, they pushed to integrate housing, work and public life. But one constant tool used by racists to stop progress was fear of Black men as criminals. In Thomas Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s 1905 book The Clansman, a rapist ex-slave Gus is on the prowl; it was remade into the 1915 film Birth of a Nation. Just the accusation of Black male criminality was enough to enrage Southern mobs to roast a man alive, cut his genitals and take photos.\nIn each decade, people pushed across that line between citizen and Other. In response, conservatives held up the Black criminal to scare voters. The Ghetto Brute was in Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s 1968 Law and Order campaign, in female form during Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s 1976 campaign stump speech on welfare queens, in George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s 1988 Willie Horton campaign ad and in McCain\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 campaign painting Obama as a Muslim terrorist. Using Black criminal imagery, Republicans tried to dismantle welfare and the New Deal by portraying them as giving white taxpayer money to the undeserving poor, aka Black brutes, sambos and jezebels.\nIn the 21st century, the white majority is shrinking, its voting base split by class and gender. Working-class males lean Republican and women and college-educated whites go Democrat. The electorate is becoming more diverse, but we\xe2\x80\x99re reeling from the century and a half of fearmongering about Black criminals. Crime is the Republican code word for race, which is why we fight over Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell and the portrayal of Obama as a Muslim terrorist. And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we fight over Trayvon Martin. In stripping him of innocence, conservatives attacked us. In affirming his right to live, we safeguarded our own.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolice are more cautious when approaching a black man,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly said on his show. \xe2\x80\x9cOverwhelmingly violent crime is generated by young black men.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut a chorus of progressive writers pointed out that gun violence is down nearly 50 percent since the 1990s, most crime is intra-racial, next door and itself is the result of socio-economic pressure, not just race. The image of rampant Ghetto Brutes is not real, Black and Latino men are not attacking whites. The sad truth, I thought, is that we are killing each other. But many of us looked at President Obama and thought we were entering a postracial America, one that could help our youth, not criminalize them.\nJuly 13, 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 A friend and I bought tickets to see Fruitvale Station, a film about Oscar Grant, a young Black man shot dead by an Oakland transit cop, when a text beeped on my cell phone. It read: George Zimmerman acquitted. Swaying on my feet, I stared at the text feeling rage and grief roll through me.\nThe Cycle of Violence\nAugust 5, 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 Returning home, I tried to make sense of the Zimmerman verdict. Mass protests had dissolved. No social movement pushed ahead. Instead we\xe2\x80\x99re left with a conservative debate on \xe2\x80\x9cblack-on-black crime\xe2\x80\x9d as the legacy of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s murder.\nIs \xe2\x80\x9cblack-on-black crime\xe2\x80\x9d real? Yes it is. A Huffington Post report said, \xe2\x80\x9cYoung black men are six times more likely to die from homicide than white men.\xe2\x80\x9d Nothing new here. What is \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d about it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t poor whites kill each other too? Yes, but race is different from class. Racism locates the cause of social problems in the body and, in subtle and loud ways, we are taught to see ourselves as inferior.\nMissing from Du Bois\xe2\x80\x99 definition of Double-Consciousness as \xe2\x80\x9clooking at one\xe2\x80\x99s self through the eyes of others\xe2\x80\x9d is the next phase, where one internalizes that gaze and sees others the way you were seen. Being hurt, we hurt each other. The blind fury of a male aiming a gun is the end of escalating stages of violence that begin when he first learns the weight of Blackness. It begins when he feels desperation in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice, when the word \xe2\x80\x9cnigga\xe2\x80\x9d is stapled to his skin and he becomes a moving target. It grows when he learns that his life is not worth much. And the life in commercials is one he can never live.\nThe violence of racism hits in a thousand unseen ways that add up to the \xe2\x80\x9cdepressing clouds of inferiority\xe2\x80\x9d that Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about in Letter from a Birmingham Jail. It becomes visible when I ask students of color if they made fun of or were made fun of because of dark skin color. Every time, nearly all of them raise their hands.\nAbove the warped racial identity is the economic, political and legal infrastructure that constricts life into narrow channels of opportunity. The budget-starved public schools, the endless stop-and-frisk, the unfair rates of arrest and high sentencing, the lack of jobs, the hypertension causing hearts to stop, the lack of healthcare, the constant media reflection of racist Hip-Hop caricature, the lack of gun control, our American machismo and materialism; it adds up into a grinding contradiction that explodes.\nAnd that is why \xe2\x80\x9cblack-on-black violence\xe2\x80\x9d is a symptom of white supremacy. Trayvon Martin and the young man killed on my stoop were both victims of the same system. The perpetrators were different, one a \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d Latino, the other a young Black male, but they aimed their guns at the same Ghetto Brute image, regardless of the fact that inside that image was a human being who was innocent.\nIs this the blind spot of leftist ideology? Do we focus so much on privilege and top-down power dynamics that we miss how that same hierarchy is reflected among the oppressed? Is the true sign of white supremacy not just the Zimmermans but the youth of color who die each day, unknown, unnamed and unseen? As I tried to make sense of these questions, I heard from across the street, gunshots.\n'",b'\n',b'08/17/2013 - 10:03pm',"b'The problem has been the focus on irrelevant arguments \xe2\x80\x93 some of which are actually unsupported by the evidence.\n1. \xe2\x80\x98GZ racially profiled TM\xe2\x80\x99 There is no evidence of this.\n2. \xe2\x80\x98GZ disobeyed an order by the police\xe2\x80\x99 * The civilian dispatcher, Sean Noffke, testified that he did not give GZ an order and, in fact, he, like his fellow dispatchers, are trained not make comments that sound like commands. * Noffke also testified under cross that, as a result of his asking GZ which way TM was going, GZ could have reasonably interpreted this as being asked to follow Martin. * It is also not a crime in Florida to disregard a comment made by a civilian dispatcher.\n3. \xe2\x80\x98GZ got out of his car\xe2\x80\x99 Not a crime on public property and not negligent either.\n4. \xe2\x80\x98GZ followed TM\xe2\x80\x99 Again, anyone can follow anyone on a public street unless the followee has obtained a restraining order against the follower and even there, the RS only places time, place, and manner restrictions on the person enjoined.\n5. \xe2\x80\x98GZ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really injured\xe2\x80\x99 * Under Florida\xe2\x80\x99s self-defense laws, one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be injured AT ALL to use deadly force * No one is required to refrain from defending himself while another is engaged in or attempting to commit a felony.\n6. \xe2\x80\x98TM is dead through no fault of his own\xe2\x80\x99 * If you believe that TM assaulted GZ, then he IS dead as a result of his own actions.\n7. \xe2\x80\x98GZ could have left\xe2\x80\x99 * Under Florida law, there is not a duty to withdraw rather than use deadly force * TM was straddling GZ so how the latter was supposed to leave the scene is unanswered.\n8. \xe2\x80\x98GZ was armed and TM wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99 * One\xe2\x80\x99s fists can be considered weapons and can result in severe bodily harm or death. * GZ was legally carrying a weapon * There is no requirement under the law that the same weapon be used by the assailant * A homeowner can kill an intruder whether or not he has been threatened * Those that attack cannot feign surprise if they are met with superior firepower.\n9. \xe2\x80\x98Stand Your Ground!\xe2\x80\x99 * SYG is NOT at issue in this trial. * The defense is a classic self-defense case.\n10. \xe2\x80\x98Black men NEVER get to use SYG!\xe2\x80\x99 * Wrong http://tinyurl.com/nboht35\n11. \xe2\x80\x98GZ is a man and TM was a boy!\xe2\x80\x99 * As if \xe2\x80\x98boys\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t commit murder, rape, and assault everyday in this country.\n'","b'September 29, 2013'","b'Click here to see or download the third\xc2\xa0Indypendent Whistleblower Poster in full.\nDATE OF BIRTH\nDecember 12, 1970\nHOMETOWN\nColumbia, Maryland\nEDUCATION\nBrown, Yale Law School\n\nThe Indypendent\xe2\x80\x99s Whistleblower Poster Series\nThis is the third in a series of four posters featuring whistleblowers who have taken great risks to expose the crimes and the misdeeds of our government.\n July (Issue #188):\n\t\tEdward Snowden\n August (Issue #189):\n\t\tJohn Kiriakou\n September (Issue #190): Jesselyn Radack\n November (Issue #191): Chelsea Manning\n\nCAREER\nRadack was a Justice Department legal ethics attorney when the U.S. launched its \xe2\x80\x9cWar on Terror\xe2\x80\x9d in 2001.\nControversial Case\nIn December 2001, Radack warned superiors at the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the FBI had committed an ethics violation during its interrogation of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Taliban\xe2\x80\x9d John Walker Lindh. Radack concluded that Lindh\xe2\x80\x99s confession might have to be sealed, something the government was loath to do in its first major post-9/11 terrorism prosecution.\nInitial Retaliation\nRadack received a scathing job performance review in February 2002 and was told to look for employment elsewhere.\nWhat She Leaked\nIn June 2002, Radack supplied copies of more than a dozen emails she wrote on the Lindh interrogation to a Newsweek reporter after the DOJ only released three of her emails to the judge in Lindh\xe2\x80\x99s case. After Radack\xe2\x80\x99s leak, the DOJ reached a plea bargain deal with Lindh rather than taking his case to trial.\nFurther Retaliation\nAnonymous DOJ senior officials attacked Radack in the media as a \xe2\x80\x9ctraitor\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist sympathizer\xe2\x80\x9d while the government leaned on her new employer, a Washington D.C. law firm, to fire her. The government vendetta against Radack included helping her employer contest Radack\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment benefits claim, referring ethics complaints against Radack to the two state bar associations where she is licensed and placing her on the government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNo-Fly\xe2\x80\x9d list. By her count, she was subject to at least 19 extra security searches before being removed from the list.\nLegal Status\nThe DOJ pursued a criminal investigation against Radack for 15 months before declining to file charges in September 2003. Facing the threat of disbarment, she was unable to get legal work for years.\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t Keep a Strong Woman Down\nIn 2008, Radack became Director of National Security and Human Rights at the Government Accountability Project, an organization that defends whistleblowers. Radack\xe2\x80\x99s clients include NSA whistleblowers Thomas Drake and William Binney and CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou. Radack has authored a book on her experience and is a columnist at the Daily Kos.\nIn Her Own Words\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs someone who has been the target of a ruthless leak investigation, I believe \xe2\x80\xa6 that government employees should be protected, not retaliated against, when they disclose conduct evidencing illegality, fraud, waste or abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\nON THE WEB\nwww.whistleblower.org (Government Accountability Project)\nwww.dailykos.com/blog/Jesselyn Radack\n@JesselynRadack\n'",b'\n',"b'September 27, 2013'","b'I can still recall my sense of \xe2\x80\x98shock and awe\xe2\x80\x99 when, at home on a break from four months of \xe2\x80\x98occupying\xe2\x80\x99 a tent, two General Assemblies (GAs) a day and multiple protests each week, I watched on live stream as the police charged through the Washington, D.C. encampment at Freedom Plaza. They tore down our tents, took apart the kitchen and issued threats to the Occupiers still standing their ground. From home, I did the only thing I could do and responded to tweets that the Occupiers were hungry and put out a call to send them pizza. When all was said and done, a few symbolic tents remained, but the Occupy movement was declared (according to mainstream media)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dead.\xe2\x80\x99\nI sat at home for months, depressed, deflated and yet unwilling to be defeated. In July, 2012, I was in Paonia, Colorado to scatter my parents\' ashes, when a local guy named Sid and I decided to protest the younger Koch brother, Bill\xe2\x80\x99s, WWII tank that was to lead the July 4th parade. Brandishing a homemade sign that read \xe2\x80\x9cAre You Trying to Buy the Planet or Just Take It\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cDemocracy Can\xe2\x80\x99t Be Bought\xe2\x80\x9d on the reverse side, Sid stopped the tank and parade, and I filmed it on my phone. I uploaded it to YouTube, and to our surprise, it became the lead story on the Rachel Maddow show the next night.\nFueled by that incident, an idea began to germinate. Perhaps the mainstream had declared Occupy dead, but I knew of Occupy groups who were still meeting, protesting and making a difference. I realized that if we continued to film and report everything we could, some of it would inevitably get picked up by the mainstream \xe2\x80\x94 and, better yet, we might find the way to creating our own mainstream.\nSo, I bought a camera, took a week-long course in film production, packed my Prius and, on January 13, 2013, I took off with my Japanese Chin, Wilma (my constant dog-companion since her rescue while I was still living at Freedom Plaza) to search for Occupy. I truly did not know what I would find, and must admit to a gnawing fear that I was going to return home to report that Occupy was, in fact, dead. As it turned out, that was most definitely not what I discovered.\n59 Points on the Map\nStarting in Maine in the middle of a blizzard, I traveled south, zigzagged into the mid-West, hit the West coast and took a northern route home to Vermont some four months later. I put more than 30,000 miles on my car, and visited fifty-nine points on the map. I met Occupiers and activists who, whether or not they clung to the \xe2\x80\x98Occupy\xe2\x80\x99 moniker, had been compelled to action by Occupy and, like me, were unwilling to say \xe2\x80\x98uncle\xe2\x80\x99 just because the encampments were gone. I have some 400 hours of footage that will, I hope, document some of what I discovered. As I skim through photos and footage, I know that what I found in the people I met and the places I visited, was more than resilience, more than courage, more than determination: it was hope.\nIn Maine, I met activists who told me about a proposed 23-million gallon \xe2\x80\x98natural\xe2\x80\x99 gas tank in a seaside village called Searsport. Its dimensions were gargantuan, and the impact on this scenic, sleepy tourist town would be devastating. But, the infrastructure was in place and, in spite of very determined Maine activists and Occupiers, there seemed little hope of stopping the Denver-based corporation that would pipe Canadian gas to be stored in the tank and then shipped across the Atlantic.\nA couple months later, when I arrived in Denver, a young Occupier named Mark Chavez enthusiastically told me how Occupy Maine had contacted Occupy Denver to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we send you lobster suits, will you wear them and protest at the annual shareholders meeting. It\xe2\x80\x99s our last chance to stop this tank.\xe2\x80\x9d Believe it or not, the decision to scrap the tank was made just a couple days before I arrived in Denver. Wow, I thought. This is what Occupy looks like.\nAppalachia\nIn Kentucky, I walked with a group called Footprints for Peace. One of the walkers had helped to organize an OWS walk from New York to D.C., and now they were walking through snowstorms, with chanting Buddhists at the helm, to bring attention to mountaintop removal. On the first day of the walk, we met Rick Handshoe, a Kentucky mountain-man, who was packing up his home to move because he could no longer survive the health effects caused by the mountaintop removal next to his home.\nEvery day, Rick, someone who ""don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a high school diploma,"" had been testing the water seeping out of his mounting. Rick\xe2\x80\x99s family had owned the mountain rising up behind his trailer for generations, and since the explosions began on the property next to his, big craters, eroding soil and gushing streams of toxic water began to appear with increasing frequency. Day after day, Rick tested and warned his family and neighbors of the dangers. He showed them his fingernails that were falling out.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody listens,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are owned by the coal companies. But, they\xe2\x80\x99re my people. I gotta keep telling \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x9d Rick wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an Occupier except on his own land, but he is a hero who exemplifies the Occupy story. This man with no diploma provides the EPA with the water tests they use in their own analyses, and every day he battles the corporate giants. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is dead here, now. Even the bugs are gone,\xe2\x80\x9d Rick says. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if they stop now, nothing will come back in my lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the Deep South\nOne day, I got a Facebook message from a woman in Jackson, Mississippi that said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99d consider coming down to little old Jackson.\xe2\x80\x9d You bet I would \xe2\x80\x94 and, in Jackson, I found another shining example of what Occupy still means to a tireless group who now call themselves \xe2\x80\x98family.\xe2\x80\x99 When I arrived at the scheduled time and place, I was met by three men, a street artist, a Libertarian and a homeless fellow, who would, I was told, take me to where I would be staying. With a slightly apprehensive shrug, I followed, thinking, \'It\xe2\x80\x99s all an adventure.\'\nThey led me through an upper-middle class suburb to the home of a couple, probably in their late 60\xe2\x80\x99s or early 70\xe2\x80\x99s. Everyone embraced everyone and I was ushered inside. Soon, the rest of their Occupy family began to arrive bringing food, wine and hundreds of stories to tell. My host couple turned out to be life-long Republicans who just got fed up and one day decided to \xe2\x80\x98go down to that Occupy picnic and see what it was all about.\xe2\x80\x99 They went back every day. When the encampment shut down, this widely diverse group continued to meet twice a week. Among them they had acquired 2 acres of land and were working on building a self-sustaining community.\nThey also acted as escorts for women coming to the only women\xe2\x80\x99s health clinic in Mississippi that still provided abortions. They apologized for the fact that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to be out in the streets much anymore. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t getting arrested. What they were doing was occupying OWS ideals and providing proof that we can be \xe2\x80\x94 and some of us are \xe2\x80\x94 the change we want to see.\nAs I write this, the names, faces, places and tireless (and, too often, thankless) efforts of groups and individuals across the country flood my consciousness. In New Orleans, I visited a warehouse that had been full of old tires and machinery. By the time I got there, Occupy NOLA had not only cleared and cleaned the warehouse, they had jackhammered through the cement flooring and installed plumbing, a bathroom and a kitchen. There was a bicycle shop, a puppet theater staging area, an information center and activist library. There was a stage for holding concerts and places where traveling occupiers could sleep.\nGulf Coast Waters\nTraveling along the bayou, I stopped in Rayne, Louisiana to talk with Cheryl Foytlin, mother of six, who has been arrested countless times after trying to rescue a pelican drowning in oil from the BP spill. From Rayne, I drove to Seadrift, Texas where I spent a day and night with the infamous Diane Wilson, a shrimper who has been single-handedly fighting the chemical companies and oil refineries since she realized they were dumping their toxic waste into the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe fishermen are mostly gone now, but Diane refuses to let up on her fight to restore some kind of environmental sanity to earth and sea. When I visited, she was just off a 60-day hunger strike fighting the tar sands pipelines. Most recently, I was in Washington, D.C. to support her in court after another hunger strike that culminated when Diane landed on the White House lawn trying to bring attention to the prisoners long ago cleared for release but still detained at Guantanamo.\nA stop that brought me to my knees was Houston. I was staying with a couple who had a beautiful home on Galveston Bay, smack in the center of a picturesque inlet bordered on one side by the tip of the Houston Ship Channel, a tangled mass of steel, pipes and furnace plumes gushing fire and smoke into the stratosphere, and on the other side by a counter-symbol of oil money, the Houston Yacht Club. I woke up on my first morning there and was lured outside by a paint-brushed sky as the sun rose over the Gulf. In the center of the scene, a heron stood, staring out at the pinks and purples that bled into this deceptively tranquil toxic sea. It was the perfect metaphor for the juxtaposition of majesty and travesty for which this country has come to stand.\nToxic Tour\nBut, what shocked me most was my meeting later that day with a father and son team, Juan and Bryan Parras, who founded and ran an organization called T.E.J.A.S. (Texas Environmental Justice Activist Services). They took me to their offices, where they were providing shelter for the Tar Sands Blockaders. Then, one evening, Juan took me on his \xe2\x80\x98toxic tour.\xe2\x80\x99\nAfter a look at the recycling plant which emits all kinds of hazardous pollutants and is conveniently located in Juan\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood of lower-middle class homes whose residents are mostly people of color, Juan\xe2\x80\x99s pick-up exited the ship channel highway and wove between the towering spires of steel through the maze of industry-in-action. We entered the very bowels of the Houston Ship Channel. I could literally feel the heavy metal toxins in the air I was breathing into my lungs. I\xe2\x80\x99m not prone to headaches, and yet, the longer we stayed, the worse my head ached.\nJuan told me his son, Bryan, could no longer conduct these tours because his headaches got so bad. As I\xe2\x80\x99m fretting over my own level of toxicity intake, Juan points out the neat, small homes with yards literally backed up against the storage tanks. People live here. Children were playing in the yards. Patio furniture and barbecues decorated patios. \xe2\x80\x9cValero Oil built a school here,\xe2\x80\x9d Juan tells me as we approach a floodlit football field. \xe2\x80\x9cTo show their \xe2\x80\x98good will,\xe2\x80\x99 they named it Cesar Chavez School.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJuan, who worked alongside Chavez in his younger years, laughs at the irony. \xe2\x80\x9cSee those particles in the air where the lights are?\xe2\x80\x9d He points to a foggy haze of swirling particles weaving patterns in the glare of the floodlights. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\xe2\x80\x99s smog, or fog, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Those are heavy metals. Mercury. Benzene. Butadiene.\xe2\x80\x9d I stared in disbelief at young boys tossing a football, a little girl riding a tricycle in circles inside a picket-fenced yard, a couple sitting on their front porch. Juan went on to tell me that children living in a two-mile radius of the Houston Ship Channel have a 56% greater chance of developing leukemia than kids living outside a 10-mile radius. I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen anything like it. One more time, I understood what we were fighting for.\nForeclosure Fighters\nIn Seattle, I met up with Josh Farris, who had come to Freedom Plaza at one point. The Seattle Occupy was fraught with problems and distractions, and so Josh began looking around for ways to contribute the most help. He discovered that housing foreclosures were a major problem in the ethnically diverse neighborhood where he lived, and so he began working with people willing to fight the banks. He introduced me to two women, one Chinese and the other Puerto Rican. Both had faced foreclosure when due to illness and job loss they had missed a payment.\nIn Portland, Oregon, I stayed with a woman in her 80\xe2\x80\x99s, Nan Wigmore. She had been a regular at the encampment there, and I had met her in Chicago at the NATO protests some months earlier. When the Portland encampment got shut down, Nan decided to open her home to some of the Occupiers and her house was now a bustling center for Occupy activity.\nOf all the people I met, and all the issues being confronted, there was one issue that touched me more deeply than all the rest. Early in my journey, I took a detour to St. Louis to join some of my Veterans for Peace friends (who had provided security at Freedom Plaza) in protesting Peabody Coal\xe2\x80\x99s devastating mining practices. I was filming the rally in front of the corporate headquarters when Don Yellowman, Dineh from Navajo Nation in Arizona, began speaking. He was talking about genocide, the broken treaties, the children with asthma, the preponderance of kidney disease, diabetes and cancer, the formerly pristine springs now infested with arsenic and other heavy metals, the elders without electricity or potable water. He talked about the part played by Peabody Coal, the U.S. government, the tribal government, the BIA and BLM in all of this.\nAs he was talking, I realized I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what I was filming. I was blinded by my own tears. My parents had retired to Arizona, and I used to drive through the Navajo Nation, stopping at the Cameron Trading Post for Navajo tacos. My parents befriended weavers and bought Navajo rugs. And, yet, as politically aware as I considered myself, I was largely ignorant of the genocidal policies carried out for generations on the people of the First Nations.\nTar Sands Resistance\nAfter St. Louis, I went to Oklahoma for the Great Plains Tar Sands Resistance Camp and met Casey Camp-Horinek and her brother of AIM fame, Carter Camp. They described the web of pipelines under their land, their inability to grow crops because of the toxins left behind in the soil in the name of progress, their culture being eroded away as younger generations were forced off the reservations to find work. They talked about how they used to go to dances and birth celebrations; now, they went to at least one funeral a week.\nI went to Arizona and New Mexico and, again, met Don Yellowman, who presides over a group called The Forgotten Navajo People. I stayed with his parents and his mother, Louise, showed me her photo albums with pictures of her as a child herding goats. She talked about the history of her people, and the hope she still holds for the survival of their culture. Don\xe2\x80\x99s father came out to meet me in a wheelchair. He ran heavy machinery at the uranium mines. Louise told me he had handled yellowcake with his bare hands. Now, he is on dialysis several times a week.\nI also went to Pine Ridge, where I met Charmaine White Face, who works with Defenders of the Black Hills to get the open pit uranium mines that are killing her people cleaned up. Garvard Good Plume and Richard Broken Nose talked to me about the case of broken treaty rights they want to take to the World Court in The Hague. Nathan Blindman has followed the paper trail of the property at Wounded Knee where the relatives of the people I met had been massacred by the U.S. Calvary.\nAs I talked to my new friends of the First Nations, I understood that although they were the embodiment of all the principals the Occupy movement stood for, although they continued to invite us to join them and begged us to listen and learn from their traditional ways, they could not, as occupied nations, become part of a movement named \xe2\x80\x98Occupy.\xe2\x80\x99\nAs I drove toward Vermont, heading home where my daughter and grandsons live off-the-grid, and where I was about to open our house to activists and community members, I teared up thinking of the heroes I met. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s called Occupy or First Nations or just a solitary guy in Kentucky, the meaning is clear. We are family. We\xe2\x80\x99re in it together. We all live downstream.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nOccupy\xe2\x80\x99s Legacy: A Massive Burbling of Possibilities, by Ethan Earle\nRadical Reflections, by Matthew Wasserman\nSeven Ways Occupy Changed America \xe2\x80\x94 and Is Still Changing It, by David Callahan\nThe Indypendent is a New York City-based newspaper published 13 times a year.

Once called \xe2\x80\x9cBig Labor\xe2\x80\x9d by critics, it was rightly credited with winning the sorts of concessions that allowed working people to enter into what was identified as a rising and broadening middle class. Today, less than one in eight workers is unionized. Organized labor is no longer \xe2\x80\x9cbig.\xe2\x80\x9d It even borders on the powerless when it comes to reversing soaring levels of inequality and beating back the decades-long corporate attack on its own members\xe2\x80\x99 living standards, let alone being a champion for the rest of the workforce. That\xe2\x80\x99s been the case at least since the 1980s, regardless of which party controlled the White House.\nWith the prospect of its own extinction now recognized even by itself, the AFL-CIO \xe2\x80\x94 the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest labor federation, with 57 affiliated unions and 13 million members \xe2\x80\x94 gathered in early September for its quadrennial convention in the City of Angels seeking something of a miracle.\nIn the weeks and months leading up to the convention, AFL-CIO president and former miners\xe2\x80\x99 leader Richard Trumka emphasized that it was no longer possible for the Federation to continue with business as usual. This once-insular labor federation decided to throw open its doors \xe2\x80\x94 announcing that it would aim to organize much of the 89 percent of the U.S. workforce that is not in a labor union and do so in tight, mutually beneficial coordination with non-traditional worker organizations that do not engage in collective bargaining. It pledged to work with movements of feminists, youth, people of color, the LGBTQ community and the lowest paid members of the workforce, who even many of the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s own affiliated unions traditionally ignore.\nWelcome Words\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe labor movement consists of all workers who want to take collective action to improve wages, hours and working conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d reads the key resolution adopted at the convention. \xe2\x80\x9cOur unions must be open to all workers who want to join with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne hopeful observer in attendance, the National Organization for Women\xe2\x80\x99s Terry O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, called the effort \xe2\x80\x9cnot just transactional, but transformational.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCertainly the rhetoric is bracing and welcome. If you go by a strict reading of the resolutions passed, this is a solidly progressive organization ready to speak with brio for all working people and not just its current members and retirees. Calls were made for a smooth transition to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, rejecting the politics of austerity, organizing and acting in solidarity globally with other workers, transforming Obamacare into health care for all, ending mass incarceration, organizing the anti-union South and supporting workers of all sexual preferences.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s come a long way from the cretinous public remarks of former AFL-CIO head George Meany, who in 1972 said that the \xe2\x80\x9cDemocratic Party had been taken over by people named Jack, who look like Jills and smell like Johns.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHopeful too are the plans to build up state and local labor federations as active community organizations with an eye toward cooperating with militant social movement organizations on their goals as well. One more indication of the changing times: the AFL-CIO no longer calls itself \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d labor movement but a part of the labor movement. Admitting that alone is refreshing.\nThe selection of Tefere Gebre, 45, the charismatic, Ethiopian-born leader of the Orange County, Calif. Federation of Labor, as the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s new executive vice president at least symbolizes the change in direction.\nMany Hurdles\nDespite all the positive signs, the effort to revitalize the AFL-CIO faces many hurdles. The largest one is the unremitting hostility of corporate America toward all but the most servile unions. But other challenges flow from the contradictions built into the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbig tent\xe2\x80\x9d structure, which includes more conservative elements such as unions that represent workers in the construction, energy and armaments industries. They hold jobs in the most politically conservative sectors of corporate capitalism, which employ a correspondingly lower proportion of females and people of color \xe2\x80\x94 workers that have been most closely touched by the progressive movements of the last four decades.\nPredictably, Trumka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cy\xe2\x80\x99all come\xe2\x80\x9d call is garnering opposition from key elements within the Federation that bridle at being yoked to environmental groups like the Sierra Club, which has opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, coal-fired power plants and more.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese groups have no equity with the work,\xe2\x80\x9d groused Laborers International Union of North America President Terry O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan, a vocal supporter of the Keystone XL pipeline, which could create thousands of temporary construction jobs in the Great Plains states where it is slated to be built. \xe2\x80\x9cI grew up believing you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get in each other\xe2\x80\x99s way \xe2\x80\xa6 but these groups are taking food off our table.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt this point, the concerns of the AFL-CIO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOld Guard\xe2\x80\x9d seem overstated. Despite press reports that the Sierra Club and the NAACP are already part of the effort, no pact has been made to bring them on board as affiliated organizations. The only group of national note that can be pointed to is the National Organization for Women. The eight other announced organizations \xe2\x80\x94 including Make the Road New York and the Blue Green Alliance (a longstanding coalition of unions and environmentalists chaired by the heads of the Steelworkers Union and the Sierra Club) \xe2\x80\x94 suggest only the potential of an inclusive strategy.\nOld Habits\nOn political action, myopia still prevails. The Federation\xe2\x80\x99s preference remains for insider politicking over the kind of mass campaigning that has been a hallmark of recent efforts by fast-food and Wal-Mart workers to win a living wage and union representation (see page 15). President Obama, perhaps the worst Democratic chief executive since Woodrow Wilson, sent a lackluster three-minute video message to be played during the Convention and was praised repeatedly for keeping the door open to union lobbyists. Open it is, but not in any way answerable.\nA senior staffer told me that the Federation isn\xe2\x80\x99t looking back much further than the 2010 election debacle or ahead to more than the 2016 election cycle. And while there is some interest in grooming explicitly labor candidates to run in Democratic Party primaries, there will be no jump-starting of insurgent independent campaigns that would challenge officeholders from both parties.\nSadly, the Federation\xe2\x80\x99s newfound feistiness appears to stop at the proverbial water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. There was a cathedral-like silence hanging over any discussion of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s then-anticipated Syria bombing plans. The AFL-CIO also refused to take a position on the bloated military budget, even tabling a Wisconsin state federation resolution to do so. Rationalizing the silence on military spending, another senior staffer told me that the group\xe2\x80\x99s leaders didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the Obama administration caught in \xe2\x80\x9ca pissing contest with the GOP over what to cut in the federal budget.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe AFL-CIO wants to reinvent itself, and it should, but too much of the convention had an air of rebranding if not magical thinking. Still, the Federation remains the largest institutional actor on the left, with hundreds of millions of dollars in its war chest and a clear self-interest in forming alliances with movements for social change, in order to turn back the wave of attacks coming not just from the far right but from corporate America, too. Succeeding here means more than talking a better talk; it means artfully putting into practice its stated commitment to social justice unionism for all working people, not just for its own members. It also needs to ensure that its affiliates are on board so that cooperation with allies is transformational and not just a series of tactical, momentary alignments.\nMichael Hirsch blogged daily from the AFL-CIO convention for The Indypendent. He is a longtime labor and political writer.

In towns and cities across the country, fast-food workers have been walking off the job. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to work. They are supposed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I take your order, please?\xe2\x80\x9d But, in a series of strikes that escalated to national scale in late August, workers at Burger Kings, Dairy Queens and other leading quick meal palaces weren\xe2\x80\x99t taking orders, neither from customers nor from managers. Workers in Colonel Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s army broke rank at Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets. Picket lines went up under the golden arches of McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s. America\xe2\x80\x99s low-wage underbelly rumbled.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is standing up today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naquasia LeGrand, a 21-year old New Yorker who divides her time between working for two Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets \xe2\x80\x94 one in Brooklyn, the other in Queens \xe2\x80\x94 and organizing for a union. She was among a crowd of 100 or so that shut down a Midtown Manhattan McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s before dawn on August 29.\nThe atmosphere inside the restaurant was like that of a revival. The two-story McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s was packed to capacity with strikers and their supporters, clapping and chanting \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t Survive on $7.25\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a reference to the New York State and federal minimum wage. A local pastor emceed the occasion while city council members jockeyed for stage time.\nThe job action on August 29 was the latest show of force from a campaign demanding union recognition and $15 an hour that began with a one-day strike involving 200 people in New York City last November. Since then, the union drive has taken root in several East Coast and Midwestern cities, including Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Detroit, Flint, Mich. and Milwaukee. The fresh wave of strikes marked new territory for the campaign as workers stepped out of kitchens in West Coast and Southern cities \xe2\x80\x94 Los Angeles, Seattle, Tampa, Fla. and Raleigh, N.C., among them.\nEven in Texas\nJose Avila, a 22-year-old Houston resident who works for Subway, watched on TV as the fast-food strikes spread earlier this year. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t we stepping up?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself.\nThat summer, campaigners with the Texas Organizing Project approached Avila while he was working behind the counter at his job. It was one of the hottest days of the year and the store\xe2\x80\x99s air conditioner was broken. On top of that the restaurant was understaffed and Avila was doing a job meant for two.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey came in and they saw the struggle I was going through,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey spoke about the strike they were planning, and I decided to jump in and fight the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d Avila\nand approximately 100 other fast-food workers joined the national strike, holding rallies, pickets and speak-outs at numerous Houston restaurants.\nThe new escalation from fast-food workers comes at a time of soaring inequality in America. A recent review of data from the Internal Revenue Service by researchers at the University of California, Oxford and the Paris School of Economics finds earnings for those in the top 1 percent of the U.S. economy increased by nearly 20 percent last year. The study further finds that 95 percent of wealth gains made since the 2008 recession went to America\xe2\x80\x99s richest individuals. Meanwhile, ordinary Americans are working longer hours for less pay. Mid-wage jobs constituted 60 percent of jobs lost in the recession while low-wage jobs accounted for 58 percent of those recovered, according to the National Employment Law Project.\nThe $170-billion-a-year fast-food industry exemplifies what workers seeking to lift themselves and their families out of poverty are up against. Despite its high rate of profitability, workers in the industry earn wages that hover at or just above the legal minimum.\nThe National Restaurant Association, acting as a mouthpiece for America\xe2\x80\x99s leading fast-food giants, has pushed back, saying that $15 an hour is an unreasonable expectation and that price hikes and layoffs would ensue should the demands of striking workers be met. Other detractors have claimed that employees could be replaced by iPads.\nBut iPads can\xe2\x80\x99t wipe down tables or fry french fries. In Australia, the minimum wage is $15.96 and the cost of a Big Mac remains relatively the same as in the United States. If the industry is looking to cut costs, campaigners contend, they can start with salaries at the top: The average fast-food executive makes $25,000 a day, more than what a fast-food restaurant employee takes home in a year.\nFor his part, President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour last spring, but the measure has stalled in Congress, where lawmakers are instead debating cuts to food stamps that millions of low-wage workers depend on. Even if Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposed wage increase were to pass, the slight bump would do little to raise those employed in minimum-wage industries out of poverty.\nBanding Together\nImpatient, fast-food workers are banding together and seeking to force change from below. The union drive has been underwritten largely by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which has provided funding for localized community groups like the Texas Organizing Project and New York Communities for Change to mobilize on the ground. Some critics have speculated that the strikes have more to do with the SEIU flexing its political muscles and creating a media spectacle than achieving the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s stated objectives. However, workers again and again say they decided to join the campaign because they felt that they had little to lose.\nKareem Sparks, a 30-year-old Brooklyn McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s worker, joined the union drive in the run-up to a previous round of walkouts, which took place on July 31. Once his employer got wind of it, he was offered a promotion. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted to make me a manager,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI turned them down, since that would mean I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t organize, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSince the union drive got underway in New York City and began spreading nationwide, there have been numerous instances of higher-ups firing workers and using other forms of retaliation, such as slashing their hours to prevent them from unionizing. In response, workers have mobilized in each other\xe2\x80\x99s defense, in some instances shutting down restaurants and negotiating with management to rehire laid-off employees. Other cases are being handled through courts by lawyers retained by the local campaigns.\nWhen Sparks talks to fellow workers, he reminds them that they have rights on the job. \xe2\x80\x9cSupervisors and general managers automatically assume that they can intimidate workers and make us feel like we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right to organize, when we do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nOften, these conversations happen at fast-food restaurants, where, when he can afford it, Sparks takes his children for dinner.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople in this country like to eat fast food,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI indulge in it myself. When I get a chance to go out and spend a little money on fast food, I try to acknowledge the workers. I try to educate them on the situation. I show them clips on my cell phone of me talking to the press, being on TV. I basically encourage them to join in because we need as many people with us as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBroader Victories\nAnalysts agree that the odds are stacked against the fast-food campaign winning collective bargaining rights or what would amount to a near doubling of wages. The union drive, however, could have broader effects on the living standards of millions of people across the country.\nNelson Lichtenstein, the director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California\xe2\x80\x93Santa Barbara, doubts the campaign will achieve its immediate demands. Instead, he argues that the struggle could lead to broader victories if it keeps the discussion of wages front and center in the national dialogue.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your goal is a collective bargaining agreement at the 42nd Street McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, you might get it actually. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t do you any good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lichtenstein, explaining that the majority of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s fast-food outlets are run by individual franchise owners and organized by regions. This structure enables mega-chains like McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s to divert responsibility for abusive labor practices while generating super-size profits. Such a victory, however, could set off a larger wave of concessions from the industry in major metropolitan areas \xe2\x80\x94 compromises that likely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t include contracts but would most certainly feature a bump in pay.\nMore significantly, Lichtenstein explained that the strikes could energize the political campaign challenging lawmakers to raise the minimum wage. They also bring the subject of inequality and the stagnation of wages to the forefront of the policy agenda.\nNaquasia LeGrand, who took part in the first one-day strike last November in New York, was more optimistic. The August 29 job actions multiplied her sense of what is possible. She expects that, as more and more workers see their counterparts joining in the union drive, it will have a snowball effect and their numbers will continue to increase. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole world could stand up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPeter Rugh is a freelance reporter and activist based in Brooklyn, New York.

Putting Inequality on the Agenda\nBefore Occupy came along, the Tea Party narrative was dominant in American politics. Conservative activists told a story about how big government was strangling taxpayers and small businesses, holding back growth, fiscally bankrupting the nation, and attacking freedom. Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s rise was a pivot point away from that narrative. It legitimized public discussion of inequality and helped embolden Democrats to talk about this problem, including President Obama, who gave a hard-hitting speech on inequality in Osawatomie, Kansas just three months after demonstrators first appeared at Zuccotti Park.\n2. Shaping the 2012 Election\nOccupy had a huge influence over the 2012 election by putting inequality on the national agenda just six months before the GOP selected a wealthy financial leader as their nominee. By late spring 2012, the Obama campaign was pounding Mitt Romney with a toned-down version of Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s anti-Wall Street message. That message would have felt jarring and off if Americans hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spent the fall of 2011 hearing discussion of economic disparities and financial abuses thanks to Occupy. Instead, the message resonated deeply with a prepped public and Romney never recovered from being cast as a plutocratic villain.\n3. Influencing Tax Debates\nOccupy didn\xe2\x80\x99t just push inequality into the mainstream of politics, it also helped legitimize one key solution to inequality: raising taxes on the rich. In the past, conservatives had been able to successfully demonize plans to raise taxes on high earners using a broad \xe2\x80\x9ctax-and-spend\xe2\x80\x9d attack on liberalism. But in 2012, President Obama drew on broad public support when he campaigned on a platform to raise taxes on the rich and was largely inoculated against the typical anti-tax attacks. After the election, Republicans capitulated in the fiscal cliff negotiations and allowed taxes to rise on high earners for the first time in twenty years. Governor Jerry Brown of California also secured higher taxes on the wealthy in 2012 as a result of a successful ballot initiative. Occupy deserves a share of credit for these victories.\n4. Reviving Progressive Populism\nThe Tea Party had a monopoly on populist energies before Occupy. Bizarrely, the right had successfully channeled American anger at an economic collapse caused by Wall Street into a stepped-up assault on government regulation and redistributive policies. Occupy grabbed some of that anger for the left and re-directed it to the proper targets: corporations, financial elites and the politicians who cater to them. Occupy awoke dormant activist energies on the left and became the strongest display of progressive populist muscle since the anti-war movement 40 years earlier. This new energy has helped fuel a variety of organizing efforts unrelated to Wall Street or the economy. Occupy will endure as a seminal moment in the lives of young progressive activists who grew up largely during the Clinton and Bush years with no memory of mobilized progressive energy beyond the 2008 Obama campaign.\n5. Seeding the New Union Organizing\nThe wave of worker protests and strikes over the past year, targeting low-wage employers, is partly an outgrowth of Occupy. By showing the power of public protests, combined with online organizing and support from the progressive media and policy world, Occupy encouraged other social movements. And by elevating the problem of inequality, Occupy helped frame the larger challenge that low-wage workers were taking on when they walked off of jobs paying poverty wages amid record profits for their employers. Thanks partly to Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s groundwork, the strikers and protestors have enjoyed wide public and even elite support.\n6. Keeping the Heat on Wall Street\nWhile Occupy was a broad attack on economic and power disparities, it was also a very specific attack on a financial industry that remained arrogant, unrepentant and under-regulated three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s sharp and fresh critique of Wall Street power came at a crucial moment, as regulators struggled to implement the historic Dodd-Frank law and various civil suits against financial firms remained pending. Putting the misdeeds of the financial industry back in the spotlight helped bolster the push for accountability amid massive resistance by the industry and their political allies in Congress.\n7. Offering Alternatives to Capitalism\nFinally, Occupy helped strengthen a weak thread of the American progressive tradition \xe2\x80\x94 namely, exploring alternatives to capitalism. After the protests and encampments were gone, a significant piece of Occupy energy was channeled into building and promoting various cooperative and collective forms of commerce and community. These efforts have brought new energy to a growing constellation of work focused on creating community-based wealth, worker ownership, state banks and the like. This part of the story is still ongoing. But, ultimately, Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s legacy in questioning capitalism may be its most enduring\nAn earlier version of this list appeared on the Demos Policy Shop blog at demos.org/policyshop.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nOccupy\xe2\x80\x99s Legacy: A Massive Burbling of Possibilities, by Ethan Earle\nRadical Reflections, by Matthew Wasserman\nWEB EXCLUSIVE: Searching for Occupy, by Crystal Zevon\nThe Indypendent is a New York City-based newspaper published 13 times a year.

You\xe2\x80\x99re not alone. Popular sentiment today largely wavers between ignoring, dismissing, making fun of and lamenting the death of Occupy. Nor has the view from the left been a whole lot cheerier. With an old and familiar penchant for criticism, its many tendencies \xe2\x80\x94 from liberal to progressive to socialist to anarchist \xe2\x80\x94 have caught Occupy in a veritable crossfire of all that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done right.\nThese various strains of doom and gloom perpetuate the idea that Occupy is disappearing and disappointing. This negativity engenders self-fulfilling prophecies and, more importantly, is mistaken. Even those critiques that hold water obscure a simple truth: Occupy has opened a new, fertile terrain of radical thought and action that will yield unexpected and important fruits for decades to come. The Occupy movement, as so many deem it, isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much finished as not yet truly begun.\nBirthing Pains\nOccupy was born in downtown Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Zuccotti Park, first conceived as a protest against the economic inequality embodied by nearby Wall Street and the New York financial district. However, from the start Occupy was much broader than any one political issue. An early invitation to the 99% brought a kaleidoscopic range of people to the park to voice their own stories of exploitation and oppression. Equal parts social media and police violence sparked a wildfire that was clearly waiting to happen, and within weeks there were hundreds of Occupations across the country.\nOver the next months, millions of people across the United States \xe2\x80\x94 more than at any time since the 1970s \xe2\x80\x94 came into contact with open political dissent. The slogan \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the 99%\xe2\x80\x9d lent the protests a common symbolic language around which people coalesced, crossing long-standing boundaries in the process. The issue of economic inequality was forcefully reintroduced into mainstream public discourse, with the top 1% of economic elites unequivocally fingered as the villains. Hundreds of thousands of people participated directly, while countless more donated money or food, joined a credit union or otherwise sought to act in solidarity with the multi-faceted politics of Occupy.\nAnd then, as suddenly as they began, the Occupations were over. In November 2011 police swept through and cleared nearly every encampment, injuring dozens, arresting hundreds and generally causing constitutionally-suspect mayhem. Attempts to reoccupy were put down with brutal resolve, and protestors were left unsure how to continue. Occupiers themselves often had no place to go. Some uneasily argued that the timing was actually good, since the coming cold would have soon forced the occupations to voluntarily disband anyway. Most agreed that Occupy would go underground for the winter to organize, prepare and emerge stronger when the weather warmed. But spring arrived and, measured against the grandeur of the previous fall, proved to be a letdown.\nWhile mainstream media had treated Occupy Wall Street like an existential threat from the start, it was at this point that many on the left started to have their own existential crises about Occupy. Should there have been more concerted attempts at reoccupation? Was Occupy hampered by a lack of specific goals, or an unwillingness to engage electoral politics? Should it have refocused on Wall Street and economic inequality? Did it belie a lack of organizational discipline, or the limits of horizontalism? Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have blossomed into a more cohesive movement? Why had Occupy faded out so quickly? Why do the capitalists always seem to win?\nA Series of Happenings\nMany of these dour assessments are underpinned by an at least tacit, if not explicit, assumption that Occupy is a movement, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether accurate. To judge Occupy as a movement, particularly in popular discourse, is to compare it to the likes of the Civil Rights or Anti-War Movements of the 1960s and 70s. The implication is that Occupy is a phenomenon with a coherent, singular vision and a linear direction.\nRather, I would argue that Occupy, at least during the period of Occupations, constituted a series of transformative Happenings. Borrowing from the art world, Happenings are extended performance pieces without set narratives. They intervene in different natural environments, inviting onlookers to shape their form and participate in their development. In the late 1950s, Happenings became popular as forms of cultural agitation in which mutual collaboration trumped the authority of any one artistic intention. In this way Happenings sought to be radically democratic, breaking through the traditional walls that separated the artist, the viewer and the art establishment.\nOne of the great tricks of neoliberal culture is to convince us that history has ended, that there is no alternative. The Occupations, as Happenings, were a series of interventions that profoundly disturbed dominant culture and opened a wide array of new possibilities for those who encountered them.\nOn an immediate level, Occupy changed the lens though which protest in the United States is popularly viewed. It upended a decade or more of single-day protests that had largely disappointed, bringing hundreds of thousands into the streets to protest everything from the Iraq War to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose with little discernible effect on either policy or the mainstream public. More and more, progressives had been left to ponder the old, uneasy question about whether a tree falling in the forest makes a sound if nobody is around to hear it. The \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent,\xe2\x80\x9d aesthetically jarring nature of the Occupations forced Occupy into the self-reflexive media cycle \xe2\x80\x94 in which news begets news begets news \xe2\x80\x94 and made countless people see and hear something profoundly different.\nThis power, palpable through all the hundreds of Occupations, enabled people to think of Occupy as a single entity. But as soon as the Occupations ended, this particular fa\xc3\xa7ade was lifted and the Happenings\xe2\x80\x99 participants dispersed \xe2\x80\x94 a realistic outcome, considering how varied their backgrounds and goals were from the start. Those tethered to the idea of Occupy as a defined unit or identity, or indeed as a movement, were left disappointed.\nCertainly, the speed and physical presence that marked Occupy in its first month had in some respects flattered to deceive, and its sudden withdrawal from public space created a vacuum effect. Compounded by the sharp decline in media coverage, sympathizers felt suddenly deflated, as if Occupy had come this close to doing something truly transformative but instead was dead and gone, before it ever really had the chance to change the world. In reality, Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s Happenings had already succeeded by leaving a massive burbling of possibilities in their wake.\nOccupy Sandy\nOver the past year, Occupy Sandy has been the most visible project to emerge from these Occupy Happenings. When Hurricane Sandy came ravaging through New York on October 29, 2012, former Occupiers were the first non-local responders in many of the city\xe2\x80\x99s poorer neighborhoods. Indeed, before the storm had even hit land, the social and working networks created during Occupation were abuzz with activity. The same nimbleness that had permitted Occupiers to join flash mob protests or defend the park at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice was employed to rush to the aid of families in distress. The ability to quickly assemble practical resources (vans, buckets, food) proved instrumental that night and in the days that followed. Experience at quickly adapting to uncertain conditions in a moving environment allowed Occupiers to tailor their help more closely to residents\xe2\x80\x99 needs.\nFrom the start, Occupiers engaged the organizations that were already in place in the neighborhoods where they intervened. They visited churches, schools and community centers where relief centers were being set up, asking what was needed and doing what they could to help provide it. This was powerful for many reasons, but especially because it linked the radical ideals of Occupy to existing institutions in poor, and largely black and brown, communities where disproportionately young and well-educated Occupiers had previously struggled to make connections. Now, nearly a year later, disaster relief has long since given way to the arduous task of rebuilding, and ongoing work with organizations that might not share Occupiers\xe2\x80\x99 political views has challenged participants to find new ways to put their ideals into practice.\nTrue to Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s multifaceted nature in the post-Occupation phase, the many groups working under the Occupy Sandy banner have handled this differently. Work in Red Hook, for example, was ultimately torn apart by disagreements over how to engage neighborhood and business associations, other relief agencies and the police. In the Rockaways, where Occupy Sandy has been most durable, the response has been more varied, with different Occupy groups addressing different aspects of the rebuilding process. Some focus on direct services to repair damaged buildings. Others work to help strengthen pre-existing community groups by providing technical, organizational and political support. Still other Occupy groups are more explicitly radical, creating new structures \xe2\x80\x94 from community centers to worker cooperatives \xe2\x80\x94 that will help Rockaway residents pursue greater economic autonomy and political power.\nThis has been messy at times \xe2\x80\x94 as one should expect of such a large-scale and, let us not forget, young attempt to implement radical visions in a real-life setting \xe2\x80\x94 but it has also been beautiful in what it has accomplished. Literally thousands of people have been helped by Occupy Sandy, and their communities have been touched by and imbued with Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s radical politics. Meanwhile, the notion of disaster capitalism \xe2\x80\x94 the exploitation of natural disasters to enrich elites at the expense of the poor \xe2\x80\x94 has gained traction in mainstream society, and an alternative, in which these same disasters are instead used to build democratic power in low-income areas, has been positively enacted.\nOccupy Sandy\xe2\x80\x99s fiercest critics, many of whom actually come from other tendencies within Occupy, have maligned it as accommodationist charity work that diverts valuable energies and holds little transformative power. Aside from being presumptuous, their arguments simply miss the point. They assume that Occupy has one direction it should take (and ostensibly that they have a better idea of what that direction is), when its real strength is an ability to open up new avenues of action within the wider spectrum of the left. And indeed, other Occupy efforts are finding their way into our society in surprising and often potent ways.\nOccupy Everywhere\nSome of this work continues to operate principally under the Occupy banner. Occupy Our Homes, which has been especially active in Atlanta, Los Angeles and Minneapolis, supports people who are fighting bank foreclosure and eviction. Occupy the SEC has moved away from direct action and into the trenches of legal filings and amicus briefs, serving as an important watchdog in the murky, wonky world of finance. Strike Debt!, which has shed the Occupy moniker but firmly maintains its roots, spreads theory and practice about how debt is used to exploit and debilitate the poor. Through its Rolling Jubilee campaign, Strike Debt! has bought more than $12 million dollars of mostly emergency-room medical debt and abolished it. Other similarly-minded and overlapping groups, like Tidal Magazine and Occupy University, develop and make accessible educational materials for people to learn about the theory that drives these types of projects.\nMeanwhile, other Occupy efforts \xe2\x80\x94 particularly those oriented toward direct action and street protest \xe2\x80\x94 act as the left wing of existing progressive campaigns. In New York City, Occupiers have thrown weight behind wide-ranging community efforts to challenge the police department\xe2\x80\x99s stop-and-frisk policy. Largely organized through grassroots work before Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s time, this movement appears positioned to put an end (for now, anyway) to the heinous practice by which black and brown people throughout the city are arbitrarily subjected to unconstitutional police searches. The recent wave of fast-food worker strikes has also received crucial support from people emerging from Occupy, often working in conjunction with Service Employees International Union (SEIU) members and Fast Food Forward activists. Beginning in New York last November with 200 striking workers, the movement has spread outward to over 60 cities and pulled in thousands of workers across the country. At the same time, an array of different Occupy constellations, many going under different names, have joined forces with groups like 350.org and Tar Sands Blockade to fight the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.\nAnd the work directly linked to Occupy makes up only a part of its impact. There\xe2\x80\x99s been a wave of new worker cooperatives, mutual aid groups and community finance efforts, to name a few. Participants in these efforts have drawn from the lessons of solidarity economy practiced in the park and are now seeking to reproduce more sustainable practices in the world around them. Others have gone to work for a wide range of pre-existing organizations: from radical non-profits to more established NGOs to book publishers and media outlets and, yes, even to the electoral political arena. Who, for instance, could imagine the meteoric rise of mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio \xe2\x80\x94 whose campaign has centered on the economic inequalities that make for a Tale of Two Cities in New York \xe2\x80\x94 without Occupy having forced these issues back into public debate? And while not every one of these people or groups will fight for the revolution until the end, the rise in radical political energy is already having tangible effects on our economic and political systems and will continue to do so for years to come.\nThe Sweet Hereafter\nNow that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised our glasses and cleared the air, I\xe2\x80\x99ll close with a more sober assessment of what we can expect from Occupy going forward.\nSobriety of course requires recognizing the problems. After all, the Occupations took shape as microcosms of the 99%, and this mass of humanity naturally brought with it a lot of accumulated baggage, as well as a few demons. To say it another way, while Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s little worlds brought into relief many of the ills of broader society, there were others that it simply reproduced. Many if not most Occupy projects have struggled with issues of race, class, gender and privilege. Prime culprits have of course been privileged white males, and too many meetings still get dominated by those who can stay longest and are most steeped in the language of victory.\nAnd the dangers are by no means just internal. Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s open nature also makes it uniquely permeable to the problems that pervade the world around it. Not surprisingly, this often starts with the market. Most Occupy work is not economically sustainable, forcing participants to work multiple jobs or otherwise exploit their own labor. In this context, the non-profit industrial complex is always knocking at the door, offering paid positions that sometimes allow its converts to take on the system but on other occasions lures them in to simply reinforce it. There is also the lurking threat of active cooptation: corporations, politicians and other powers-that-be seeking to take the edge off this new wave of activism, harness it and use it for their own gain. And of course the most sinister danger: the infiltrators and informants, sadly prevalent in Occupy since the start and to this day.\nThese are all very real issues. Taken together, they threaten to stifle the more transformative social justice work emerging from Occupy. They also threaten to debase Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s image \xe2\x80\x94 and by extension that of radical protest as a whole \xe2\x80\x94 in mainstream society.\nI ask you to toast with me because sometimes positivity is a political act. We live in a society that is eager to define and desperate to make sense of the messy world around it. Occupy defies this impulse. It is uncertain, constantly evolving and resistant to simple categorization. Will the Occupations return? No, at least not the way they happened in late 2011. But no two Happenings can or should develop in the same way. To bring about radical social, economic and political change, the next wave of Happenings \xe2\x80\x94 that is, of mass demonstration and mobilization \xe2\x80\x94 will have to look different; it will need to pierce and take hold and shake our society in another unexpected way. And perhaps the greatest danger that Occupy faces is the inability of many of its supporters to simply let it breathe and become.\nOccupy has already created an activist base that will bolster the ranks of the next generation of progressive actors. In most cases, they will fight to push their respective projects further to the left. This will be true for activist groups, of course, but it will also include media, academia and government, among others. The extent to which Occupiers will be able to shape and guide these institutions will be key to its ultimate impact. However, where movements usually end \xe2\x80\x94 when a sufficient number of participants become convinced that enough has been won \xe2\x80\x94 Occupy will go on, precisely because it is something different to each person who was part of it. It can only end when each of their visions for change is realized.\nBecause of this, if for no other reason, the radicalism stirred up by Occupy will play a key role in the next period of great social upheaval in the United States, which appears quite likely in the context of ongoing austerity and a political and socioeconomic structure cracking under the weight of its own contradictions. And yes, Occupiers will figure prominently in the next great movement in U.S. history. Who knows? It might have already begun, quietly, right before our eyes.\nEthan Earle is a project manager at the New York office of the Rosa Luxemburg Siftung and the author of the study, \xe2\x80\x9cA Brief History of Occupy Wall Street,\xe2\x80\x9d published by RLS in November 2012.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nRadical Reflections, by Matthew Wasserman\nSeven Ways Occupy Changed America \xe2\x80\x94 and Is Still Changing It, by David Callahan\nWEB EXCLUSIVE: Searching for Occupy, by Crystal Zevon\nThe Indypendent is a New York City-based newspaper published 13 times a year.

Firstly, Occupy started with different aims (income inequality) and objectives (or lack of objectives? vs the Tea Party's bashing of the federal government). Tea Party started from the top (meaning, it was funded by large doners Koch Brothers, for example) and then supported by celebrities and news outlets (Fox News on the down-low, Glenn Beck, etc), practically from the beginning whereas Occupy was endorsed by organizations but never directly supported with resources or coordination.\nTea Party picked up momentum from the top, whereas Occupy sparked momentum from the bottom.\nThis all translates to a different kind of movement. Without help from the top, Occupy is left to fend for itself. Without any specific legislative goals, there really is no thrust to put someone up for candidacy or support a particular platform.\nI know this was mentioned in the article, but I really think that was a mistake. It really should have learned from the Tea Party and pressured legislators to do something. Community work is fantastic, but it's not how things move legally in the United States.\n""","b'October 31, 2013'","b'WEB EXCLUSIVE: In response to ""Occupy\'s Legacy: A Massive Burbling of Possibilities,"" in the September Indypendent.\nThe Occupy movement achieved a lot. It raised people\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness and put the issue of economic injustice into the national discourse. As its message catalyzed discontent and outrage, it sprouted all over the nation, from Boston to Oakland, Atlanta to Youngstown. \xe2\x80\x9cWe Are the 99 Percent\xe2\x80\x9d is the most effective concept or slogan to come out of the left in the last generation, both as a point of unity and in identifying the enemy (although it might be more accurate to call them the 0.1 percent).\nThat was great. But it was only a first step. The essential next step was to turn that mass discontent into effective political action, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where the energy catalyzed by Occupy largely dissipated.\nMany of the after-the-fact analyses of Occupy ignore this. They have been short-sightedly self-congratulatory. They act is if catalyzing discontent was enough, or that Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s greatest achievement was prefiguring a utopian community with horizontal, non-hierarchical governance, or, as Ethan Earle wrote in the last Indypendent, that Occupy should not be judged as a movement, but as a series of \xe2\x80\x9ctransformative happenings\xe2\x80\x9d that stimulated radical political energy.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not enough. These attitudes reflect a vexatious tendency within the activist subculture to value symbolic displays of personal commitment more than long-term organizing.\nImagine if after the great civil-rights march of August 1963, the movement had sat on its laurels and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t that a beautiful dream Dr. King had? And we got people to start talking about ending segregation, and all those people sitting around the Reflecting Pool, black and white together, they prefigured an America with no more racism.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t. In 1964, they went to Mississippi, and some of them got killed organizing to break the sweltering heat of segregation. They tried to get the Civil Rights Act passed.\nIn 1965, they went to Alabama to agitate for the right to vote, and some of them got killed there too.\nIn 1966, they went to Chicago to try to break the unwritten segregation of the North, and in the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of the Southwest Side, they encountered racism as vile as anything in the Deep South. And they might not have accomplished anything besides getting themselves hit in the head with rocks.\nBy 1967, Dr. King had realized that to win racial justice for black people in this country, you had to win economic justice for everyone, and the power elite wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to give that up to just a moral appeal. When he was killed, he was in Memphis campaigning with striking garbage workers, for the strike is the most effective form of direct action, as it is disruptive and not merely symbolic.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve still got a long way to go, and a lot of things have been getting much worse. It\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily difficult to build a movement that\xe2\x80\x99s broader than a leftist faction of seven people, and more committed to serious change than voting for whatever Democrat mouths a few platitudes about economic inequality. But the daunting enormity of the struggle only makes it that much more urgent that we be effective. It means we need to think seriously and objectively about what has worked and what hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, about what might work and how to do it.\nThe Indypendent is a New York City-based newspaper published 13 times a year.

Not only did the health insurance corporations write the Affordable Care Act in 2009-2010 to enhance their profits, but now they also have the government and non-profit groups doing the work of marketing their shoddy products.\nThe foundation of Obamacare, the mandate that uninsured individuals purchase private insurance if they do not qualify for public insurance, goes into effect in 2014. The state health insurance exchanges where people can purchase that private insurance opened on October 1. A new organization called Enroll America was created to organize and train grassroots activists to seek out the uninsured (they even provide maps) and assist them in using the exchanges.\nThe Uninsured\nCan you imagine this scenario with any other industry? Billions of public dollars and tremendous efforts are being spent to create new health insurance markets, advertise them, subsidize their products and actively solicit buyers for them. This is being done with the belief that the solution to our health care crisis is to reduce the number of people who are uninsured. But our health care crisis runs deeper than that. And having health insurance in the United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same as having access to necessary care.\nObamacare does not resolve the fatal flaw in our health system \xe2\x80\x94 that it is a market-based system rather than a public health-based system, as is the case in all other industrialized nations. Market competition does not improve health outcomes because it consists of health insurance corporations competing for profits by selling policies to those who are the healthiest and denying and restricting payment for care. And regulation of insurers doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work either. Although rules in Obamacare give the appearance of changing insurance company behavior, insurers are already working around them. Remember, the health insurers wrote the rules.\nThis illusion that the health insurance corporations are regulated under Obamacare is one of the reasons that progressives have been seduced to accept a market- based health system rather than continuing to push for the system most of them desire, a single-payer Medicare-for-all national health program. Defenses of Obamacare ignore the long history of private insurance domination and are based on the hope that this time things will be different. But Obamacare has not changed the fact that private insurance companies view their plans as products and have no more allegiance to human health than does Big Energy, which will stop at nothing to drill, frack and blow up the planet for profits.\nExperience at the state level with similar reforms and a look at current health trends show that Obamacare will leave tens of millions without insurance, will increase the percentage of people who are underinsured, will increase financial barriers to necessary care and will further privatize health care. Cutting out the multitudes of insurers and creating a single publicly-financed universal health care system is the only way to solve our health care crisis.\nTweaking the System\nDuring and after the health reform process, the President explained that since most people were happy with their health insurance, we should work with the present health system to improve it. This was the reason given for not enacting a Medicare-for-all system.\nFrom the outset, it is important to realize that 80 percent of the population is generally healthy and that this is the population that private insurers prefer to enroll. People may believe that their coverage is satisfactory, until they have a serious health problem and discover that the out-of-pocket costs and restrictions on their care make necessary care unaffordable.\nIs it wise to try to tweak the current system? Will that bring us to universal coverage? The answer is no. About the best that has been achieved by tweaking the present system at the state level is reducing the number of uninsured people by half. That is what happened in Massachusetts, where legislation similar to Obamacare was passed in 2006.\nThere are currently 48 million uninsured people in the United States. At its best, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that Obamacare will leave 31 million people without health insurance when it is completely rolled out. And even that estimate may be too low. Experience at the state level showed that none of the plans that were similarly hailed as comprehensive met their coverage goals before they failed fiscally. Without effective cost controls, care remains unaffordable.\nShifting the Costs\nAs health care costs have soared in the United States, the trend in health insurance coverage has been to shift more of the costs onto the individual. This has primarily been done through what are called Consumer-directed Health Plans (CDHPs), which require co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance. This means that patients have to pay thousands of dollars in addition to their premiums before and after their insurance kicks in.\nThese up-front costs are barriers to care. Considering that 76 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck without significant savings, the money simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t there to pay for visits to the doctor, tests or prescriptions. A health survey by the Commonwealth Fund last year found that 80 million people reported not getting care due to cost, 75 million were having difficulty paying medical bills and four million (over two years) went into bankruptcy as a result.\nThe result of CDHPs is that patients self-ration by avoiding or delaying necessary care. And so many people are currently self-rationing that the rise in health care spending in the United States has slowed over the past five years. Reducing access to necessary care is not the kind of cost-control that should be promoted, but Obamacare does just that.\nThe health insurance exchanges sell four tiers of coverage, identified by metals. The lowest levels, silver and bronze, will pay for 70 and 60 percent of covered services once deductibles are met. \xe2\x80\x9cCovered services\xe2\x80\x9d is the key phrase. Health insurers are restricting their provider networks for plans sold on the exchanges to exclude places where sick people go, large health centers and safety-net hospitals, and to limit the number of doctors. This will force people to go out of the network and bear more or perhaps all of the cost of their care.\nThe silver and bronze plans have lowered the bar on what is considered coverage. These are levels that will leave people at risk of financial ruin if they have a serious accident or illness. And these are the levels that most people will purchase. Subsidies are available for those who qualify based on the price of a silver plan, and because the subsidies are inadequate, people will migrate to the cheapest plans.\nThis model means that people will still get the care they can afford rather than the care they need. It means that more people will have insurance but will not be able to afford care. In Massachusetts, eight out of 10 people who see themselves as \xe2\x80\x9csick\xe2\x80\x9d report that health care costs are a serious problem for them.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s quite a gift to the insurance companies. Millions of new customers will pay premiums, and because of the out-of-pocket costs, may not actually use health services. A cap on out-of-pocket costs was included in Obamacare, but has been delayed for a year because insurers said their computer systems were not ready to manage the caps.\nThousands of Waivers\nThe delay on out-of-pocket spending caps is one of the tricks that insurers are using to protect their profits. They have used many others, and we can expect more.\nObamacare was written with the help of large insurance corporation lobbyists and others from health industries. The reform process was led in the Senate Finance Committee by Liz Fowler, a former WellPoint executive and Senate staffer. After Obamacare was signed into law, Fowler was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to oversee the regulations. Insurance representatives have also played an active role at the state level in forming the exchanges. It is no secret that most state insurance commissioners have close ties to the industry.\nThe effect that this level of industry influence has had is that thousands of waivers have been issued by HHS to water down provisions in the bill and the industry has participated in writing definitions of terms to their advantage. For example, one area of tension concerned the requirement that insurers spend 80 to 85 percent of what they collect in premiums on health care (called the Medical Loss Ratio, MLR). This requirement simply led to a redefinition of care, and the term was interpreted so broadly as to include insurance brokers. Dr. John Geyman of Physicians for a National Health Program writes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe insurance lobby won a number of concessions, including counting expenses of quality assurance as medical costs, allowance to deduct many of their taxes from their total premiums before calculating their MLR, and the ability to appeal for a lower MLR standard for up to three years in states where \xe2\x80\x98there is a reasonable likelihood that market destabilization could harm consumers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nPerhaps one of the most egregious examples of insurance company behavior took place six months after Obamacare was signed. At that point, by law, insurers were no longer allowed to deny new policies to children on the basis of pre-existing conditions. Faced with a potential reduction in profit margins, many health insurers simply stopped selling new policies for children. In essence, they pulled the product from the shelf. HHS was able to entice the insurers to sell policies again by offering increased premiums and limiting open enrollment periods.\nThis is one of the ways that insurance corporations cherry pick only the healthiest people. Under Obamacare, some large insurers are avoiding most of the insurance exchanges and are focused instead on offering plans to employers or serving as benefit administrators. Another method is restricting networks to avoid facilities that care for the sickest or by reducing the number of providers in a plan. And the third will be to pull out of geographic areas if they prove to be money-losers.\nInsurers are not allowed to charge more for people with pre-existing conditions, but they are allowed to charge more for smokers, up to three times more based on age and more in geographic areas where health care costs are high or the population has greater medical needs. As it is with markets, health insurers will sell their products where they can make the most profit.\nWe will watch and see what insurers do over the coming years. We can expect them to justify charging higher premiums. In the past, they have reduced premiums temporarily to lure people in or avoid government intervention and then raised them later. We can expect them to push for lower levels of coverage or fewer required services. And we can expect that HHS and state insurance commissioners will be compliant, as they have been.\nTowards Greater Privatization\nAnother myth used to lure progressives to support Obamacare is to say that it is a step in the right direction, meaning towards universal coverage. But Obamacare is actually a step towards greater privatization of our entire health system. It lacks provisions to stop the consolidation of ownership of health facilities by large for-profit entities, something that large insurers are doing more. It cuts funding to safety-net hospitals. And under Obamacare, public insurances are becoming more privatized.\nMedicaid is state health insurance for people with low incomes. More states are moving their Medicaid patients into managed care organizations (MCOs). MCOS, such as Amerigroup which was bought by WellPoint after Obamacare passed, are for-profit administrators that compete with each other to cover the healthiest patients and are incentivized to cut care. Currently 75 percent of Medicaid patients are in MCOs and that number is expected to increase further under Obamacare.\nMedicare is public insurance for people 65 years of age and older and who are disabled. One of the early goals of Obamacare was to cut back on Medicare Advantage plans, which are essentially private insurance plans paid for through Medicare. The Advantage plans primarily insure the healthiest seniors and cost more than traditional Medicare. Instead of cutting back, the Obama administration boosted payment to the Advantage plans. And enrollment in the plans has increased by 30 percent since 2010.\nThere is good reason to suspect that Medicare may be completely privatized in the coming years by being turned into a defined premium plan rather than the defined benefit plan that it is now. This means that seniors would receive a certain amount of money each year to purchase private insurance instead of knowing each year that they would have Medicare with its required benefits. This is the plan being pushed by Republican Congressman Paul Ryan. The idea came out of the National Commission for Fiscal Responsibility and Reform created by President Obama in 2010.\nNot the Reform We Need\nLooking at Obamacare from a distance, it is difficult to see it as anything more than a law designed by and for the health industries that profit from the current health system. The regulations can be circumvented or waived. The insurers can continue to find innovative ways to avoid the sick and not pay for care. And overall the system is becoming more privatized, which is the opposite direction from the real solution, Medicare for all.\nMedicare for all, also called single-payer, would create a health system that treats health care as a public good rather than as a commodity. The system would be paid for up front through progressive taxation. There would be no premiums or out of pocket costs, so while taxes would be higher, people would be able to get the health care they need rather than being limited to what they could afford.\nIn a Medicare-for-all system, every person in the United States would be in the system from birth to death and it would cover all necessary care. It would be much simpler to use because there would be one set of rules and all health professionals would be included. People would have more choices of where to go for care and would be able to change jobs or travel freely without worrying about not being covered. Barriers to receiving care would be removed. There would be no more worries about whether a person qualifies for this or that because everyone would have access to the same standard of care.\nCurrent health care spending in the United States is more than adequate to pay for a Medicare-for-all system. This has been proven time and again in studies at the state and national levels. In fact, a Medicare-for-all system would allow better management of our health care dollars and the ability to negotiate for fair prices for medications and services. And Medicare for all would have a broader impact on our public policy because the bottom line would be public health rather than profits. Clean air and water, access to healthy food and fewer toxins in consumer products would reduce health care spending rather than padding the pockets of the health industry.\nThe work for Medicare for all continues. There is a bill, HR 676, in the House of Representatives that is collecting co-sponsors and which outlines a Medicare-for-all plan. Single-payer groups throughout the country continue to press forward. And Physicians for a National Health Program will continue to document the problems with our health system and educate about Medicare for all. It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial that single-payer supporters continue to articulate what a real solution to our health care crisis would look like and not silence themselves out of a misguided desire to shield Obama and the Democrats and the poor decisions they have made from attacks by Republican demagogues.\nWe cannot cross our fingers and hope that Obamacare \xe2\x80\x9cworks.\xe2\x80\x9d That attitude means hundreds of thousands will suffer and die from preventable causes and millions of families each year will continue to go bankrupt because of medical illness and costs. The moral imperative is to realize that health care never has been and never will be a commodity and to stop treating it as such by taking it out of the marketplace altogether.\nMargaret Flowers is a pediatrician and co-chair of the Maryland chapter of Physicians for a National Health Plan.

So far, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been an urgent need \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m young, in good health, and have been lucky enough to not get into any accidents. Yet. I also don\xe2\x80\x99t have health insurance, principally because I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. The same goes for many of my peers in their twenties, who are healthy, glaringly poor and more often than not, lacking access to health care.\nOn October 1, the health care exchanges that are the main feature of the Affordable Care Act went live. An estimated 8.6 million people all over the country went on the federal health website in the first three days, and savvy news commentators \xe2\x80\x94 those that found a breath between discussions of the Obamacare-centered government shutdown \xe2\x80\x94 pointed to the program\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on young people\xe2\x80\x99s participation for fiscal success. The Obama administration hopes that 2.8 million uninsured youth, of about 18 million total, will sign up for health coverage through the exchanges. As the logic goes, healthy young people must pay in to make the health insurance offered on the marketplace exchanges affordable by balancing out the costs for their sicker, and often older, counterparts.\nAnd yet, many of us don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves to be in a position to pay into anything. Those of us who are roughly 30 and under \xe2\x80\x94 also known as \xe2\x80\x9cmillennials\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and more specifically, those who entered the labor force after the beginning of the Great Recession, are faced with a dilemma: try to do what you want, or try to achieve financial stability. Opportunities for accomplishing both are scarce.\nMy family immigrated to the United States when I was a child, and as a teenager I was studious enough to get accepted into one of the top universities in the country and poor enough to receive a massive no-strings-attached financial aid package. Upon graduating, brand-name degree in hand, I set about trying to begin the career I wanted with the goal of eventually getting paid in the process. The year was 2011, and the moment coincided with the outpouring of hundreds of thousands of beleaguered young people, many of whom were saddled with student loan debt and struggling with limited economic prospects, into the nationwide Occupy uprising.\nClose to two years of living at home, several unpaid internships and countless hours spent worrying about my lack of financial security later, I scored a job. It\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyable and in my chosen field. It also pays just enough for me to cover rent for a tiny Brooklyn bedroom, groceries and the occasional beer with friends. Making it cover my health care costs would be a stretch, even with the subsidies offered by Obamacare.\nYoung adults disproportionally lack health insurance: over a quarter of Americans ages 18-34 aren\xe2\x80\x99t insured, compared with about 15 percent of the total population. With the rollout of Obamacare, we are now faced with four options:\n1. Stay on our parents\xe2\x80\x99 insurance, if we\xe2\x80\x99re 26 or younger;\n2. Apply for Medicaid, if we meet the newly expanded eligibility requirements of earning less than $15,856 a year for a single person;\n3. Try to find our way through the maze of plans available on the newly formed health care marketplaces;\n4. Do nothing and pay the resulting tax penalty.\n\nThose of my peers in their mid-twenties who can are opting to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 insurance. I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t have that option \xe2\x80\x94 with both parents citing that adding me to their plans would cost hundreds of dollars more every month, and provide low-quality coverage at that \xe2\x80\x94 so in the coming weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be applying for Medicaid. While the coverage it offers is limited, it does pay for costly expenses like visits to the emergency room.\nIt feels like a golden stroke of luck that my current job pays just little enough for me to be eligible for the government-sponsored health coverage. But the financial dilemmas remain: what will happen if I change jobs, begin to earn a little more than I do now, lose my eligibility and have to buy coverage on the exchanges? Will I be able to afford it? What about those of my peers whose window of time to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans is quickly closing? What about those for whom it never existed in the first place?\nWith Obamacare\xe2\x80\x99s government subsidies, a single New Yorker earning $16,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 just over the law\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid threshold \xe2\x80\x94 would pay $45 in monthly premiums for a \xe2\x80\x9csilver\xe2\x80\x9d insurance plan. Someone earning $20,000 would pay $85, and someone earning $30,000 would pay $209.\nFor many of us who are just trying to survive, scraping together even $45 a month can mean having to go with less \xe2\x80\x94 less material basics, less movement, maybe even less food. Perhaps I would take on the added expense, but if I were to actually need health care, I would face hefty co-pays and deductibles, along with the prospect of insurance company officials trying to deny me services at every turn. If something serious happened to me, I would be out many thousands of dollars I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\nSo, no thanks. Young people like myself, the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cinvincibles,\xe2\x80\x9d certainly see the value in having health coverage. But it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder to see the value in tossing our meager earnings to private insurance companies, which make away with billions of dollars while so often denying care to those they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to serve.\nR.K.

From the train window, Long Island was an endless row of doll-\nhouses. Again, I looked at the text and shook my head. Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s wrinkled face lit up in my mind, then vanished. It felt like something precious was drained from my life.\nShifting in my seat, I shook it off. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like I wake up thinking of Mandela. There\xe2\x80\x99s no poster of him on my walls, no Mandela book on my shelf. Last time I thought of him was during a preview for the film Invictus, starring Morgan Freeman as Mandela. It\xe2\x80\x99s official, I thought, Morgan has been every important black man in history. Including God.\nBut as the train rocked along the tracks, I felt that sting again. As a teen visiting my friends, I sometimes saw a framed photo of Mandela on the wall, often next to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. or a painting of Black Jesus. He was a hero in the Black freedom struggle, which was the reason we sat in a new home, drove new cars and wore new clothes on our backs. Between bites of dinner, I would lean back and study those photos, then ask my friends\xe2\x80\x99 parents what they remembered of the struggle.\xc2\xa0\nA heat rose in their voices. Whatever we had been talking about was pushed out of the way. Leaning over their plates, they told us of being afraid of whites, of being pelted with slurs and spit on if they were in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time. They told us of being stopped by cops, frisked and threatened, stared at. They told us of the civil rights marches that shook the world. As they talked, I saw their faces light up.\nAfterward, my friends and I would pile into a car and drive around town. A joint was passed as we talked about girls, sports and school, and the blurry future became more blurred with each inhale. Over and over, we came back to the stories of the struggle and hit dead air, words failed us as we sat in the car and stared at the dark streets, worried we\xe2\x80\x99d never live up to that history.\nAt some point, someone always had to be dropped off in the ghetto to see a friend, get more weed or hook up with a girl. Fear knotted our chests as men on the corner eyed us, our car and our new clothes with hunger. The ragged homeless, looking like mummies, pushed shopping carts over broken sidewalks. Despair sat in the air.\nAnd this was the weight that we, college-bound and privileged, were supposed to lift from the world. But how were we to do that? Hanging over us were the faces of Mandela, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Black Jesus. It felt like they stared down at us from beyond the grave. In this spotlight of judgment, we leaned on the car and watched our friend walk into the row of ghetto homes, each one with shattered windows like broken glass teeth.\xc2\xa0\nI blinked the memory away as the train rolled into the Nostrand Avenue station. On the street was the familiar liquor store with a poster of a black woman on all fours in the window. Nearby a homeless man held out his hand. Shrugging him off, I passed by a bookstore as a video played in the window, showing a young imam who shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cAll praise is to Allah! Let me hear you say it!\xe2\x80\x9d Out front a half-circle of junkies and drunks shouted with him, holding their hands up to the screen as if being warmed by a fire.\nInvisible Factories\nWhy do we need Mandela? Or Martin Luther King Jr. or Angela Davis, Malcolm X or Harriet Tubman? Why do we need heroes?\nThe first act of oppression is to divide us from our experience. \xe2\x80\x9cNigger,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfaggot,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbitch\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a whole vocabulary of dissociation cleaves us from our bodies and frames our desires as the source of our pain. Underneath the vocabulary are social roles \xe2\x80\x94 slave, sex worker, outcast or in general the Other \xe2\x80\x94 that we are trapped inside of. In this nauseated state, we hunger for a way out. Heroes are those men and women onto whom we transfer our faith in empowerment. They are mythic figures and each represents a different path to liberation. The history of African-American hero worship is a tug-of-war between giants in the halls of history: those who point toward integration, to the larger world, and those who close the gates and order our separation from the world in order to create our own.\nEach generation has its heroes. And those faces, hanging above us, cast different judgments on our lives based on their politics. The direction of the freedom struggle takes form in this attempt to live up to the ideals emanating from their haloed faces. And unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in those houses and at those dinners, heard the stories, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that being \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d is not just an ethnic or racial identity but also a political one. It embraces the history, and almost requires a conversion experience.\nBecoming \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d is work. No one is born a race. No one is a race. It is a political fiction, not a genetic reality. But it starts, for some us, with a shock. Students and friends tell me of their verbal branding; they were called \xe2\x80\x9cdark,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdarkness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmidnight,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshadow,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctar baby\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 basically anything that scalded their skin. And of course we grew up hearing \xe2\x80\x9cnigger,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnigga,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnig.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it in the house but waited till we got outside and threw the slur at each other like a dodge ball.\nBlack psychologist William Cross mapped out the stages of racial self-identification in his 1971 paper \xe2\x80\x9cThe Negro-to-Black Conversion Experience.\xe2\x80\x9d In it he laid out five stages of the process. The first, Pre-encounter, is a child\xe2\x80\x99s sense of self before exposure to race. Next is the Encounter, in which an individual is hit with racism that \xe2\x80\x9cshocks\xe2\x80\x9d them into awareness. Third and fourth are Immersion and Emersion, during which an individual goes \xe2\x80\x9cfull black\xe2\x80\x9d and clings to their group in racial solidarity, often like a see-saw that elevates all things \xe2\x80\x9cblack\xe2\x80\x9d and devalues all things \xe2\x80\x9cwhite.\xe2\x80\x9d Afterward, solidarity plateaus and they open up to the world. Internalization, the last stage, comes when the individual becomes confident in their racial identity and balances it with their other identities. Cross designates this stage as a fork in the road: if an unhealthy balance results, the person abandons the Black freedom struggle for private life. Cross points toward a continuing commitment to political change as a truly life-affirming Black self.\nLike all good scholars, Cross revised his schema after more research. Yet the basic stages hold true. Of course real life is not a clean arc of development. And the Black identity each generation assumes is shaped by the social forces its members contend with.\nImagine children emerging into the world, brown-skinned but not \xe2\x80\x9cBlack,\xe2\x80\x9d not aware of the history that preceded them. Like invisible factories, discursive institutions transform them into a specific type of \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d person. They enter a church or hang in the street, they come from the Caribbean or are middle- class or visit family in jail. More important than the physical buildings they enter is the language they acquire. It frames experience.\xc2\xa0\nA discursive institution is organized knowledge rooted in language and acted out in a defined space. It is where they practice forms of \xe2\x80\x9cblackness,\xe2\x80\x9d each with different values, often one conflicting with the other. A clich\xc3\xa9 is the home versus the street, seen in the 2009 biopic Notorious, when Biggie Smalls as a teen changes clothes on the roof to hide his drug dealing from his mother.\nEach discursive institution \xe2\x80\x94 the church, the street, etc \xe2\x80\x94 that transforms and regulates one\xe2\x80\x99s social identity can move you through Cross\xe2\x80\x99s racial identity scale or stall you at a stage. Essentially they are regressive or progressive. Today\xe2\x80\x99s regressive discourses are the marginal but loud: Black cultural nationalism (sorry Harlem!), gangsta to corporate bling bling, Hip Hop, church-based sexism and class elitism in the form of prosperity theology and homophobia.\nSo when I first heard Amiri Baraka\xe2\x80\x99s poem \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody Blew Up America\xe2\x80\x9d and the stupid line, \xe2\x80\x9cWho told 4000 Israeli workers to stay home that day,\xe2\x80\x9d and the mostly young, mostly Black audience clapped, I winced. It reduced \xe2\x80\x9cthe Israeli\xe2\x80\x9d into a one-dimensional caricature defined by national identity. And I sensed it trapped youth of color in Cross\xe2\x80\x99s third stage, Immersion, where everything black is good and everything white is bad. Baraka is part of an African-American tradition that slips between group-affirmation and other-denigration; he usually and irritatingly framed others (whites, Jews, gays) as the source of evil, reducing their humanity to a single, false identity, telescoped by our own need for distance from the Other.\nAnd when I first heard Snoop Dogg\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 song \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t No Fun (If the Homies Can\xe2\x80\x99t Have None),\xe2\x80\x9d which basically is a gang rape anthem, I watched everyone\xe2\x80\x99s heads bobbing to the beat and waited for someone to wake from the trance and say, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, is this a rape song?\xe2\x80\x9d No one did.\xc2\xa0\nToday is not much different. Music is one discursive institution overlapping with others, but where it met street culture and was sucked into corporate America, it became a regressive narrative of blackness. Not all Hip Hop but the most popular forms of it are sexist, materialistic, homophobic and work as commercials for the 1%. On the bus home, a teen was listening to a Lil Wayne rap song on his smartphone: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so rich I go pour Champagne and don\xe2\x80\x99t drink it / Ice on my neck like I fainted / These are the thoughts of the brainless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I a Feminist or a Womanist?\xe2\x80\x9d Poet Staceyann Chin asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe student needs to know if I do men occasionally and primarily, am I lesbian?\xe2\x80\x9d In the classroom, people squirmed. On screen the YouTube video played, Chin recited a poem of loving women and how she feared rape, harassment and then being blamed for it. When it was over, I asked the students if they know anyone who was gay. Nearly everyone raised their hands. \xe2\x80\x9cDo any of you think your gay friend\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 I waited a second \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cis going to Hell?\xe2\x80\x9d\nStunned, some shook their heads as if warding off a bad smell. Others got still, peeked around and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d A debate raged back and forth over what the Bible meant and who had the right to interpret it until one student, female, with deep brown skin, raised her hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gay. And no one is putting me in Hell. Ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe has millions with her. In Black America a new generation is pouring into the spaces between the church and the street and claiming those spaces as queer, atheist, punk and poet. They are inheriting, recreating or building from the ground up progressive discursive institutions. Whether they are teen poets of color, going from Urban Word NYC to the Nuyorican Caf\xc3\xa9, parishioners of Liberation Theology churches or the nose-plugged, head-thrashing music zealots at the Afro-punk festival, they are in places that encourage them to embrace their other identities, all the while staying focused on social justice.\nThose places aren\xe2\x80\x99t widespread. And yet they contain the small channel through which youth of color can find language that connects all their fragmented parts into a whole person. And to be a fully realized human being in a white and male supremacist, homophobic, late capitalist society is dangerous. Out of necessity the new rainbow youth are radical. They showed up at Occupy Wall Street or rallied at the Million Hoodie March after the Trayvon Martin verdict.\nAfter the rallies, they go home. If they are gay, they risk their lives by holding hands with their lovers. The painful irony is that they most likely walk past Afrocentric bookstores with posters of Malcolm X or maybe now, in honor of his death, Amiri Baraka, two men who hid their own sexuality in order to be accepted as revolutionaries.\nThe Fire Next Time \nWhen Amiri Baraka died, I remembered these youths\xe2\x80\x99 anxious silence and wondered, what he would say to them? What answers could he give? Last time I saw him perform, he swung his bebop rhythm voice, hitting the scales to a revolutionary battle cry. Old and stooped, he vibrated with intense energy like an engine, his droopy eyes flashing, cutting, dismissing and smiling with mischievous joy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the rich eat more / than anybody else / it is reasonable to assume,\xe2\x80\x9d he chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are more full of shit.\xe2\x80\x9d The room exploded in hard, bitter laughter and I wiped my mouth, feeling a twinge of guilt at the cheap shot. And it disturbed me. It sounded like we were crushing hard coal in our mouths. Our buried rage shot into open hate before subsiding again.\nThe fury of revenge, it tasted like hot sugar on the tongue. And even though Baraka\xe2\x80\x99s politics split long ago from the cultural nationalism of, say, the Black Israelites, who shout on street corners about the \xe2\x80\x9cdevil\xe2\x80\x9d and the one true God while looking like extras from the film Gladiator, he shares with them a taste for sweet fury. It is addictive because it sublimates pain into a self-righteousness rooted in the belief that one\xe2\x80\x99s suffering is the central truth of life. Tragically, it often is. The danger comes when every unanswered question is read in the same exact way, as another symptom of oppression.\nOf course inside Baraka\xe2\x80\x99s voice is Malcolm X\xe2\x80\x99s. No one in Generation X actually knew him, but we recycled him in the 1990s as an icon of militancy. He was our myth, a pure hero from the past whose murder was a guarantee of his truth. In college, I shoplifted his cassettes from Tower Records and played them endlessly in the dorm. One speech, Blacks in Africa, a call to race war, damn near hypnotized me. I pressed the earphones tight as Malcolm X said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Morocco and Algeria they\xe2\x80\x99re telling the white man to get out, in the Congo Lumumba told the white man to get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd then his voice hit a threatening low. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in South Africa they\xe2\x80\x99re telling the white man to get out. He says he\xe2\x80\x99s not going. But he\xe2\x80\x99s got another thought coming. He\xe2\x80\x99ll either walk out or swim out in his blood. He\xe2\x80\x99ll walk out of his volition or swim out in his blood, because the Black Man has awakened. And the Black Man has united. And where there\xe2\x80\x99s unity there\xe2\x80\x99s strength. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need any guns; you just need some unity and a blade when it gets dark. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need any jets. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need any battle ships. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need any atomic bombs. All you need is darkness. Nightfall.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBrown Skins, Black Masks\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does it feel to be a problem?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked the class. A silent wave of emotion washed over their faces. Eyebrows bobbed up and down. Foreheads wrinkled like venetian blinds. On every desk was a copy of the 1903 book The Souls of Black Folk, the classic by W. E. B. Du Bois. We just read the scene when a white girl came to his New England school, looked at his brown skin and rudely ignored him; it hit Du Bois that he was \xe2\x80\x9cblack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you first know what your \xe2\x80\x98race\xe2\x80\x99 was?\xe2\x80\x9d I threaded my question like a needle to pop the pressure in the room.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t from white people,\xe2\x80\x9d a woman burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was from nigge \xe2\x80\x94 sorry, it was the kids calling me darkness or tar pit or midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d another student said and heads nodded, hummed yeses rose from them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you dark, they get on you, harass you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said and pulled her coat closed, crossing her arms.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to teach us about double consciousness again?\xe2\x80\x9d The question came from a male student in the back row. He then recited, in a robotic monotone, the famous passage, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\xe2\x80\x99s self through the eyes of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe whole class roared, slapping their desks and laughing. I taught the concept every semester and was known in the college as Professor Double Consciousness. I eyed them as they cackled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to fail you bastards.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey palmed their chests and looked at each other in shock. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut how about a question. Let\xe2\x80\x99s flip the double consciousness that Du Bois talked about in which a minority, specifically African-Americans, internalize how the majority, specifically white people, see them and each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s real. It\xe2\x80\x99s why some of you have been judged and judge others as too dark, too nappy, too ill na na.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey giggled.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen have you looked at yourself from a \xe2\x80\x98Black\xe2\x80\x99 point of view?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen have you internalized a viewpoint that showed you as beautiful or powerful or lovable because of your color, your race? If you know about double consciousness, do you have a black consciousness to heal yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\nA perplexed silence fell over the room. They looked up and around, down and up again. They searched themselves and as they did, the quiet stretched into anxiety.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you have a black consciousness?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked again, a tone of sadness in my voice. And again it fell like a single piano note between them and me.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n'",b'\n',b'01/29/2014 - 2:39pm',"b'Thank you for this very exceptional piece of writing.

In February 2009, Congress added $19 billion to the food stamp program and renamed it SNAP as part of the stimulus legislation. At the time, President Obama and congressional Democrats argued that getting money into the hands of poor Americans was one of the quickest and surest ways to fix an ailing economy.\xc2\xa0\nJust five short years later, Congress allowed the boost to SNAP benefits to expire, cutting $11 a month from each of the 47 million Americans who currently receive the assistance. Now lawmakers are fighting over how much more to cut from the program, as the House and Senate attempt to reconcile their separate versions of the farm bill. The Senate\xe2\x80\x99s version contains a $4 billion cut to SNAP, while the House has proposed cutting $40 billion. Recent negotiations haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet produced a compromise, but Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, has reportedly signaled that the Senate could live with a $9 billion cut in order to pass the legislation.\nThere is little mystery about what this will mean for the poor and working New Yorkers who receive food stamp benefits. Before this most recent cut, a fifth of all New York City residents \xe2\x80\x94 1.8 million people \xe2\x80\x94 received an average of $147.45 per month in SNAP benefits. On November 1, that average benefit level automatically dropped to $136.45 per month. But even before those cuts took effect, poor people struggled to feed themselves on an inadequate food budget. Researchers have found that most families used all of their food stamp benefits by the second week of the month.\xc2\xa0\nGrowing Food Insecurity\nFood insecurity has been on the rise in New York and nationally, despite the boost to benefit levels in 2009 and the expansion of the food stamp rolls. In 2012, 13.2 percent of all New York City residents were food insecure, up from 9.4 percent in 2000, according to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. Nationally, food insecurity rose from 10.7 percent of all U.S. households in 2001 to 14.9 percent in 2011. Congress\xe2\x80\x99s proposed farm bills are poised to make these depressing statistics even more grim.\xc2\xa0\nThough the food stamp rolls grew by 120 percent during Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, almost a quarter of those eligible for SNAP benefits in New York City \xe2\x80\x94 more than 250,000 families \xe2\x80\x94 still do not receive them. Local administration of the program has a profound impact on participation rates, and New York\xe2\x80\x99s participation rate has increased from 64 percent in 2008 to 76 percent in 2010. Much of this improvement was among the working poor, an explicit target for SNAP outreach. The Bloomberg administration also eased the application process for working families in New York by allowing people to apply online and extending office hours at neighborhood food stamp centers.\xc2\xa0\nHowever, Bloomberg also enforced federal policies that barred unemployed New Yorkers from receiving benefits unless they participated in the city\xe2\x80\x99s Work Experience Program \xe2\x80\x94 which requires beneficiaries to work at city agencies or community organizations \xe2\x80\x94 even when unemployment levels were as high as 10 percent. House Republicans are attempting to replicate this policy nationally by enforcing the work requirements for unemployed, able-bodied and childless adults, first introduced in the Clinton-era welfare reforms. So far, Senate Democrats have rejected this proposal. However, Republican governors like John Kasich of Ohio aren\xe2\x80\x99t waiting for Congress. Beginning January 1, 134,000 people became subject to being cut from the state\xe2\x80\x99s food stamp rolls unless, in the words of one affected Ohio resident, they agree to \xe2\x80\x9cwork for food.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThere are a few bright spots on the political horizon, both in New York and nationally. Mayor Bill de Blasio has signaled that he will accept the USDA\xe2\x80\x99s waiver for unemployed, childless adults, essentially waiving the work requirement for the 76,000 city residents who currently have to work for their SNAP benefits. In earlier farm bill negotiations, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand proposed actually increasing SNAP benefit amounts by using the USDA\xe2\x80\x99s low-cost food plan instead of the thrifty food plan, a minimal diet plan that is currently used to set benefit levels.\xc2\xa0\nThis proposal did not make it into the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s final version of the farm bill. Instead, Senate Democrats passed a bill that cuts funds from an already inadequate anti-hunger program in a period of high food insecurity. The heady talk of stimulus has been replaced by calls for austerity from both sides of the aisle, and the cuts are hurting the poorest Americans, those least responsible for breaking the economy in the first place.\nNew Yorkers who are not currently receiving benefits can apply online at mybenefits.ny.gov or visit their local Human Resources Administration office.\xc2\xa0The list of local centers can be found here.\nMaggie Dickinson is a doctoral student in anthropology at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Do you remember my son, an all-star wrestler? He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. He shot himself in the heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Fonzo screamed at Judge Mark Ciavarella as he stood outside the federal courthouse in Scranton, Pa., after being convicted of taking $2.8 million in bribes from the builder of the PA Child Care and Western PA Child Care detention centers.\nPart of what made the confrontation so memorable was that Ciavarella never responded to Fonzo, instead he turned his back and walked away with his lawyer. Little did anyone know that at this same time, the disgraced judge was breaking his silence in interviews with the director of a new film about the scandal.\nBoth Ciavarella and Judge Michael Conahan spent hours talking to filmmaker Robert May before they went to prison \xe2\x80\x94 for 28 and 17 years respectively. May pairs their version of what happened, and why, with that of the kids and parents who also lived through it, or in some cases, didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The result is Kids for Cash, a new documentary film that offers new and important insight into how the scandal happened, and why it is not unique.\nSome of May\xe2\x80\x99s interviews with Conahan take place on a Florida beach where the former judge vacations before his sentence begins. We learn that Conahan was the financial mastermind of the scheme and it is somewhat cathartic to hear him admit his crimes. But it is May\xe2\x80\x99s intimate exchanges with Ciavarella in his home office that provide the real tension.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted them to be scared out of their minds,\xe2\x80\x9d says the former juvenile judge who is seen earlier in the film addressing an auditorium full of high school students and telling them he would \xe2\x80\x9csend them away\xe2\x80\x9d if they appeared in his courtroom for a school-based infraction. Ciavarella stands by his allegiance to the \xe2\x80\x9czero tolerance\xe2\x80\x9d approach for misbehaving youth, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to watch the film to see if he ever admits to accepting money in return.\nMay avoids the common trap of being solely outraged about the bribery aspect of the Kids for Cash scandal by having the parents and teenagers tell their stories of how Ciavarella sent them away for weeks and months for minor infractions in order to teach them a lesson before they committed actual crimes.\nOne of the kids featured in the film, Hillary Transue, describes how she was 14 years old when school administrators called police to report that she had created a MySpace page mocking her assistant high school principal. Her mother was told she may receive a lighter punishment if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lawyer involved. But when Hillary appeared before Ciavarella he sentenced her to 3 months in a private juvenile detention center. She eventually won her release and was able to graduate from high school and go to college. May contrasts her success with most of the teens who share stories of struggling to complete their education and often wind up back in jail.\nWhat emerges through such interviews is that even without the financial gain Ciavarella incurred, his zero-tolerance polices were devastating and should be reevaluated.\nKids for Cash is set to hit movie theaters at the same time the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s Justice Department has called for reforms to policies that have contributed to the criminalization of students, known as the \xe2\x80\x9cschool-to-prison pipeline.\xe2\x80\x9d While the young people featured in the film are all white, it is widely recognized that the majority of those impacted are African American and Latino.\nA recent report by the Vera Institute of Justice that examined 25 years of research on zero-tolerance policies meant to deter drug use and violence in schools found that \xe2\x80\x9cneither schools nor young people have benefitted.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, they suffered \xe2\x80\x9csignificant adverse effects,\xe2\x80\x9d including severe disruption of students\xe2\x80\x99 academic progress. The report also notes research that shows staying in school can \xe2\x80\x9chelp to prevent young people from engaging in delinquency and crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne of the most disturbing aspects of Kids for Cash is that everyone \xe2\x80\x94 from the bailiffs to the transcriptionists to the prosecutors \xe2\x80\x94 who worked in the courtroom where Ciavarella held sway stayed quiet about the injustices that were routinely being meted out. It was business as usual. Only when one of the parents stumbled upon a group of activist lawyers in Philadelphia did the scandal come to light.\nIdeally this riveting film will be seen by those curious or concerned about the workings of our criminal justice system, and focus further attention on the lives of the kids that can still be salvaged if zero-tolerance policies are reformed.\nRen\xc3\xa9e Feltz is a producer and criminal justice correspondent for Democracy Now!.\nKids for Cash debuts in New York on February 28 at the Village AMC 7 and Empire 25 AMC.

Now, four years since picking a fight with pipeline builder TransCanada over the construction of the Keystone XL, DaSilva has emerged a changed man.\n\nSee also: Seven Reasons to Oppose Keystone XL\n\n\nDear State Department\nThe 30-day public comment period on the Keystone XL pipeline closes March 7. Comments can be submitted via regulations.gov, where the Keystone pipeline is a trending topic, or mailed directly to:\nU.S. Department of State\n\t\tBureau of Energy Resources, Room 4843\n\t\tAttn: Keystone XL Public Comments\n\t\t2201 C Street, NW\n\t\tWashington, DC 20520\nFollowing the end of public comment, the State Department has 60 days to consider comments from other government agencies and make a recommendation on Keystone XL to President Obama, who has the final decision.\n\n\nBuilding Resistance\nMore than 77,000 people have signed an online pledge to resist the Keystone XL pipeline by participating in \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceful, dignified civil disobedience\xe2\x80\x9d if the State Department signs off on the project this spring and forwards the project to the President for his final approval. The potential civil resistence campaign is being organized by a number of groups, including 350.org, Rainforest Action Network and the Hip-Hop Caucus.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf tens of thousands of people stand up as President Obama mulls his final decision and commit to participate in civil disobedience if necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the organizers wrote in an online statement, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can convince the White House that it will be politically unfeasible to go forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKeystone XL opponents say they will take aim at a wide array of symbolic targets: State Department offices, TransCanada corporate offices, Obama Organizing for Action meetings, banks that are financing tar sands oil development and communities and areas ravaged by Superstorm Sandy and along the pipeline route.\nIndigenous groups from across the Great Plains and the West have also vowed to resist the \xe2\x80\x9cblack snake,\xe2\x80\x9d which is slated to pass through traditional Lakota Nation lands in South Dakota.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an epic project, it will have an epic response from the tribal people,\xe2\x80\x9d Gary Dorr of the Nez Perce Tribe in Idaho told the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.\nFor more, see credoaction.com/sign/kxl_pledge and oweakuinternational.org\xc2\xa0and oweakuinternational.org.\n\nHe is not alone. Tens of thousands of people have been brought into the fight against the Keystone XL. Driven by large rallies on the National Mall organized by large green NGOs like 350.org, the pipeline has become an item of mainstream debate and one that, with the release of a favorable environmental impact statement from the Department of State on January 31, took a step closer toward completion. Even though grassroots efforts to halt the project in DaSilva\xe2\x80\x99s region have not succeeded, he believes the lessons he learned will be useful in the upcoming battle over the pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s northern section.\nSince all that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to connect the northern portion of the Keystone XL to its source in Alberta, Canada, is a presidential permit, the fossil fuel industry and its allies in Congress are lobbying President Obama for his stamp of approval.\nContrary to the recent findings from the State Department, anti-pipeline activists say that the 830,000 barrels of heavy tar sands crude expected to flow through the pipeline every day once it is completed will greatly increase carbon emissions and exacerbate climate change. Much to their disappointment, the southern portion of the pipeline \xe2\x80\x94 which runs near DaSilva\xe2\x80\x99s backyard \xe2\x80\x94 was completed last year and became operational on January 22, delivering oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Nederland and Houston, Texas.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we can win the fight on the northern leg, but even if we do it\xe2\x80\x99s half a victory at best,\xe2\x80\x9d said author and activist Bill McKibben.\nMcKibben\xe2\x80\x99s group 350.org has helped put the Keystone XL pipeline under scrutiny through a series of national rallies in front of the White House. Following the release of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s report, the group organized more than 200 vigils across the country on the evening of February 3.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight now, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the snows of New York,\xe2\x80\x9d McKibben said after addressing the crowd at a vigil in Manhattan on February 3. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might have to be in the snows of Nebraska if they decide to build [the rest of] this thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nChanging Views\nDown in Texas, Steven DaSilva\xe2\x80\x99s entire outlook on politics, like that of many environmentalists involved in the movement, has been completely altered over the course of opposing the pipeline. Before getting involved in the scrap against TransCanada in 2010, DaSilva had limited his advocacy to teaching teenagers in his classroom to respect and appreciate their environment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I was doing what I could do to educate future generations,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then, getting involved, I began to realize how naive I was.\xe2\x80\x9d The more DaSilva learned about tar sands and TransCanada, the more he immersed himself in activism. And the more active he became, the more frustrating the political process appeared to him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI realized that those elected officials who I originally thought were responsible to the people have neglected that responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d DaSilva recalled.\nIn 2012, when work began near DaSilva\xe2\x80\x99s house, he decided to join a ragtag group of young environmentalists from around the country who had begun flocking to Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma to organize with families and landowners living along the pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s route. Calling themselves Tar Sands Blockade, they put tremendous effort into blocking construction by chaining themselves to heavy machinery, sitting in trees slated to be plowed over and even crawling into a segment of the Keystone XL pipeline itself.\nDaSilva picked up a camera and began documenting the direct actions.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was impressed by the fact that there were so many younger individuals going out on a limb,\xe2\x80\x9d DaSilva remembered, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving up their early years to stand up to an instrument of climate change, basically putting their lives on hold to fight this battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNot all of those who took part in Tar Sands Blockade actions were millennials, however, and police in East Texas did not discriminate in their use of force. One particular moment has burned itself into DaSilva\xe2\x80\x99s mind. On October 19, 2012, an elderly friend of his was among those pepper-sprayed during a tree-sit in Cherokee County.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a nonviolent protest,\xe2\x80\x9d DaSilva said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo see local law enforcement basically responding to the wishes of a major corporation was really enlightening. These individuals are sworn to protect the public. But here you have violence being perpetrated on peaceful protests.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDespite the heavy-handed reciprocity activists received, their civil disobedience actions helped delay the pipeline and increase costs to TransCanada. Tar Sands Blockade\xe2\x80\x99s savvy media team made sure that news of the direct actions spread through social media and occasionally appeared on major news outlets. In turn, the high-profile acts of dissent helped galvanize the wider national movement against the Keystone XL and fossil fuels in general.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to be said for local organizing,\xe2\x80\x9d DaSilva explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough, national NGOs can help in terms of sharing resources.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe and other East Texas activists have also looked beyond their state. After the Pegasus Pipeline spilled 7,000 barrels of tar sands crude into the town of Mayflower, Arkansas, last March, Tar Sands Blockade helped orchestrate a community exchange between Mayflower residents and citizens of Gun Barrel City, Texas, who are forced to breathe the hydrocarbon-packed air surrounding the refineries where oil from Pegasus and other pipelines is delivered. Members of both communities shared stories about the toxic effects of the oil. DaSilva wants to build more such alliances, envisaging a grassroots network of frontline communities where fossil fuels are extracted, transported and refined.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we did a lot of our work by the seat of our pants,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve created a model that others can learn from.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThough the fate of the northern section of the Keystone XL might be up in the air, Obama has already beefed up America\xe2\x80\x99s oil and gas infrastructure over the course of his presidency, building, as he remarked in 2012, \xe2\x80\x9cenough pipeline to encircle Earth and then some.\xe2\x80\x9d The network DaSilva and others are seeking to build, of communities connected through this new web of fossil fuel infrastructure, could prove a substantial force to reckon with, whether or not the Keystone XL is built.\nThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the outcome of the struggle over Keystone XL isn\xe2\x80\x99t crucial. Politically, it would turn the tide against the fossil fuel industry, which is used to getting what it wants. In terms of our the impact on climate change, it means that less tar sands oil \xe2\x80\x94 which, according to the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s report, is 10 to 17 times more potent than conventional crude \xe2\x80\x94 will be burned.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s expensive oil,\xe2\x80\x9d said McKibben. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get out of the ground. It\xe2\x80\x99ll only be extracted if there are cheap ways to get it to market. ... If they don\xe2\x80\x99t get this pipeline built, further expansion of the tar sands is probably not going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe release of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s environmental impact report has initiated a 30-day public comment period ending March 7. Other governmental departments will also weigh in. Sixty days later, the White House will issue a draft \xe2\x80\x9cNational Interest Determination.\xe2\x80\x9d Should the draft find the Keystone XL beneficial to national interests, a coalition of groups including 350.org, Rainforest Action Network and Credo Action are planning a series of nonviolent sit-ins that will target TransCanada and investors in the pipeline. The coalition has organized more than 77,000 people to sign an online pledge to resist the pipeline \xe2\x80\x94 although far fewer have been integrated into its organizing drive. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be staging a series of direct action trainings around the country in the coming weeks and months that they hope will draw more people in.\nSome activists have expressed dismay at Credo\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, pointing out that it is the political arm of the cell phone company Credo Mobile. Yet Credo and other large NGOs opposing the pipeline are relying on activists on the ground to build for the direct actions. The success or failure of the campaign could well hinge on the strength of community resistance going forward.\nAn earlier version of this article was published at WagingNonviolence.org.\n'",b'\n',b'03/09/2014 - 11:52pm',"b'It is my opinion that this pipeline is an invasion by a foreign nation onto United States territory and as such should be repelled by whatever means, including the National Guard.

Kick their dirty oil out of our country, and kick the politicians who have backed this dirty oil out while you are at it.\n'","b'February 25, 2014'","b""The Keystone XL pipeline would allow oil producers to send 830,000 barrels a day of tar sands slurry from northwest Canada to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast and then onto global markets. To the dismay of the oil industry, environmentalists have managed to delay the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s approval for the northern leg of the pipeline, which would allow it to enter the United States from Canada. Here are seven reasons Keystone critics says the project is a bad idea:\n\nSee also: Learning Lessons for the Next Keystone XL Battle \n\n'Biggest Carbon Bomb On the Planet\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\nThe Canadian province of Alberta has 169 billion barrels of tar sands oil that can be recovered with current technologies. On top of that, an additional 1.63 billion barrels in tar sands oil could be reaped in the future as technology develops, more than five times Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s total proven reserves. This has led renowned NASA climate scientist James Hansen to describe the Keystone XL pipeline as the \xe2\x80\x9cfuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet.\xe2\x80\x9d\nProducing and processing tar sands oil results in roughly 14 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the average oil used in the United States, according to Scientific American. Further downstream in the process, when the tar sands oil is refined, it yields a byproduct known as pet coke that emits at least 30 percent more carbon per ton than an equivalent amount of the lowest quality mined coals.\nSends Wrong Message to Rest of the World\nScientists estimate that humanity can burn only one-fifth of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s 2,800 billion tons of known fossil fuel reserves between now and 2050 in order to avoid the risk of runaway global warming. That means someone has to start leaving their fossil fuels in the ground. If Canada and the United States team up to exploit the Alberta tar sands, it sends an \xe2\x80\x9canything goes\xe2\x80\x9d message to the rest of the world at a time when global cooperation in reducing carbon emissions is urgently needed.\nNot a Job Creator\nAccording to the State Department environmental impact statement on Keystone XL, the project would create only 35 permanent jobs after construction jobs dry up in a year or two. Meanwhile, renewable energy industries like solar and wind power have the potential to create millions of new \xe2\x80\x9cgreen collar\xe2\x80\x9d jobs. In 2013, the number of workers in the U.S. solar energy industry grew by almost 20 percent to 143,000, according to The Solar Foundation, while the wind industry currently employs another 80,000 workers.\nDoes Not Increase Energy Security\nSupporters of Keystone XL argue that pumping in oil from the Alberta tar sands will drive down domestic gas prices. However, oil is sold on a global market. Much of the tar sands oil that is funneled to Texas for refining will subsequently be shipped overseas where there are already foreign buyers with contracts to buy it.\nBad For the Land and Water\nTar sands mining and production are already having a devastating impact on 140,000 square kilometers (54,054 square miles) of boreal forest, a complex ecosystem made up of forest, wetlands and lakes. According to the Worldwatch Institute, the forest is home to bears, wolves, lynx and caribou and provides critical habitat for 30 percent of North America\xe2\x80\x99s songbirds and 40 percent of its waterfowl.\nTar sands operations require millions of gallons of fresh water per day. The contaminated water has to be stored underground or in giant reservoirs whose chemical soup is instantly lethal to birds that land on it.\nNasty Pipeline Spills\nTar sands slurry, also known as diluted bitumen, would travel through the pipeline for refining on the Gulf Coast. It is much more corrosive than regular crude oil and increases the risks of the pipeline leaking and spilling.\nPipeline ruptures have caused major spills of diluted bitumen in recent years in Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s Kalamazoo River and in Mayflower, Arkansas. Diluted bitumen is more toxic than regular crude oil. And because it\xe2\x80\x99s heavier, it sinks to the bottom of waterways and is much harder to clean up. Keystone XL would traverse over and put at risk parts of the Ogallala Aquifer, a shallow underground aquifer that supplies fresh water to eight states.\nBillions in Profits For the Koch Brothers\nKoch Industries owns more than 2 million acres of land in Alberta. It also controls 4,000 miles of its own tar sands pipelines, operates tar sands storage and refining facilities and is involved in oil derivatives trading. The company is poised to earn $100 billion over the next 40 years from its tar sands-related activities, according to a report by the International Forum on Globalization. The company\xe2\x80\x99s top executives, billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a network of right-wing groups and politicians who make attacking the science of man-made climate change a top priority. Profits from the Alberta tar sands will further replenish the Koch brothers\xe2\x80\x99 political war chest.\nSources: Province of Alberta, Scientific American, Worldwatch Institute, Reuters, Rolling Stone, U.S. State Department, The Solar Foundation, ThomasNet News, Indigenous Environmental Network, Inside Climate News, High Plains Water District, Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, Environmental Defence, Sierra Club, International Forum on Globalization.\n""",b'\n',"b'April 4, 2014'","b""Preparation for standardized tests given at the end of third grade would begin at the start of the second.\nHearing that baffling announcement, Brooklyn parent Janine Sopp knew something was amiss. It was 2011, and her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s school had just received a \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d from Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Education (DOE). Another year of low scores could result in dire sanctions: teacher layoffs, a new administration, even closure. So the school, rationally, would begin test prep 18 months before kids would fill in their first bubbles.\nSopp transferred her daughter to the progressive PS 146, or Brooklyn New School, but even there the millstone of yearly testing hung heavily from the school\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Sopp began meeting with a group of parents to discuss opting their kids out. \xe2\x80\x9cThat much focus on test scores,\xe2\x80\x9d Sopp says of her daughter, who has a reading disability, \xe2\x80\x9cwould erode what made her brilliant.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nSopp sent a letter to the principal explaining that Kya would be sitting out during the six-day testing period. The school responded graciously: Kya spent the week as an aide in a kindergarten class, reading to students. Heartened, her mother continued speaking with parents and helping build Change the Stakes, a New York-based anti-standardized testing group that emerged from meetings Sopp and other parents held in 2011.\xc2\xa0\nLast year, Kya and five others opted out at PS 146. This April, when New York\xe2\x80\x99s exam period for grades 3-8 begins, 80 percent of the school\xe2\x80\x99s 300 test-age students will join her.\xc2\xa0\nPS 146 students will make up part of the largest opt-out movement in modern education history. In cities from Seattle to Denver to New York, students will be pushing aside high-stakes tests in a repudiation of policies that pressure teachers to post high marks for the sake of their jobs and schools to increase scores or risk being closed. They aim to reverse the march of standardized testing and provoke a reappraisal of the ever-heightening stakes attached to test scores.\xc2\xa0\nFueling the fire is the onset of the Common Core State Standards, a set of educational benchmarks forged in nonprofit committees, promoted with gobs of philanthropic cash and guaranteed widespread adoption by the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s Race to the Top program. The standards\xe2\x80\x99 rapid and top-down implementation has parents and educators across the political spectrum up in arms.\nThis confluence of policies has brought Sopp innumerable allies. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a body of parents so determined to stop this testing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nBirth of the Testing Regime\nWhen Jesse Hagopian and other teachers organized a standardized test boycott at Garfield High School in Seattle last spring, the reasoning was clear: \xe2\x80\x9cStandardized testing is the lifeblood of the whole corporate reform movement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hagopian. Many in the opt-out community cite that successful boycott as inspiration to participate in what Hagopian hopes will be \xe2\x80\x9ca revolt against the initiatives of No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nPassed in 2002, the No Child Left Behind act laid the groundwork for the federal school accountability regime. The bill requires standardized testing in grades 3-8 nationwide and forces consistently low-scoring schools to undergo mass layoffs or outright closure. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Race to the Top program, structured as a competitive grant, pressured states to attach test results to teacher evaluations, raising the stakes of assessments considerably.\xc2\xa0\nBoth initiatives function on what some, like Tim Slekar, dean of education at the Madison, Wisconsin-based Edgewood College, call the failing schools narrative: Since public education is broken, the reasoning goes, states must close \xe2\x80\x9cfailing schools,\xe2\x80\x9d open new ones (usually privately-run, publicly-funded charter schools) and lay off teachers deemed ineffective \xe2\x80\x94 all on the basis of test scores.\xc2\xa0\nAfter pulling his own children from tests, Slekar helped found United Opt Out, a test resistance organization that provides opt-out manuals for every state in the union. Though reform policies are often sold on the language of equity, says Slekar, \xe2\x80\x9caccountability has done nothing but disrupt neighborhoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nIn the wake of No Child Left Behind, thousands of public schools have been closed, notably in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia, where 49 and 22 schools were shuttered last year, respectively. Those closings came in tandem with massive layoffs: 2,100 employees in Chicago last year, and nearly 4,000 in Philadelphia.\nMost states now employ teacher evaluations based in part on yearly assessments. As a result, Slekar says, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen punitive measures that have reduced extracurriculars and reduced deep learning in music and arts.\xe2\x80\x9d In the years following, No Child Left Behind test preparation and administration have grown to consume up to a fifth of the school year, according to an American Federation of Teachers study. Arts education has declined for all students and a range of research finds that high-stakes testing has narrowed\n\tcurricula.\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s another policy that promises to swell the numbers of test resisters this spring: the onset of newer, tougher Common Core standards and the tests aligned to them.\nEnter Common Core\nFew people other than Glenn Beck have been more active in stirring the pot on Common Core than Mark Naison, professor of African-American Studies and History at Fordham University.\xc2\xa0\nNaison became aware of the Common Core in the midst of New York\xe2\x80\x99s first foray into Common Core-aligned tests last year, when he says, \xe2\x80\x9clargely white and suburban parents\xe2\x80\x9d became upset about the testing aligned to the standards. Naison, who previously fought school closings in communities of color, quickly became a Common Core critic.\xc2\xa0\nAlong the way he helped found the anti-Common Core Badass Teachers Association, whose 40,000 members across 50 states range from old-school racial justice progressives to fuming Tea Partiers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommon Core is like the nightmare of both the right and the left,\xe2\x80\x9d Naison says, \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment and corporate control together, each time undermining the ordinary citizen\xe2\x80\x99s input into education policy.\xe2\x80\x9d Many who are wary of the Common Core acknowledge the importance of strong national education standards, like those in Finland and Singapore. It\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the Common Core\xe2\x80\x99s implementation that has them crying foul.\nThe idea for these standards hatched in a 2008 policy paper by David Coleman, now mastermind of the SAT overhaul. Bill and Melinda Gates were smitten with his recommendations, and their foundation began lavishing what became over $150 million in grants to organizations developing the standards.\xc2\xa0\nRace to the Top tied funding to states\xe2\x80\x99 adoption of new standards, and in short order 45 states had committed to the Common Core, all with very little in the way of public discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have been no trials, testing, debate or discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d says Naison. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a profoundly undemocratic initiative.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nCommon Core representatives confirm that no trial runs of the standards have taken place, though they emphasize that four rounds of comment periods from teachers and parents took place during development.\nDespite outcry elsewhere, businesses and investors haven\xe2\x80\x99t hesitated to line up behind the Common Core. \xe2\x80\x9cThe adoption of common standards\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Joanne Weiss, chief of staff in the DOE, in 2011, \xe2\x80\x9cmeans that education entrepreneurs will enjoy national markets where the best products can be taken to scale.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s music to the ears of companies like testing behemoth Pearson, which recently paid $7 million in fines for illegally using its nonprofit to develop Common Core curriculum products for its corporate parent.\xc2\xa0\nParents\xe2\x80\x99 concerns hit closer to home, though. At root, new standards promise to ratchet up testing pressures. According to Nancy Cauthen, a Manhattan parent and Change the Stakes member, parents increasingly report students bringing home vexing new assignments and experiencing unprecedented test anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cEven among parents who are divided on the Common Core,\xe2\x80\x9d Cauthen says, \xe2\x80\x9cmore parents are seeing the damaging effects of high pressure around the tests.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\n\nParents opting their children out of 2014 New York State tests, from a Change the Stakes YouTube video. Credit: Change the Stakes\nPS 146 parent Elizabeth Elsass, whose third-grade son Atticus will be opting out for the first time this April, bristles most at the amount of time spent testing: \xe2\x80\x9cAs a parent I find it almost abusive.\xe2\x80\x9d After months of prep, practice tests and benchmark assessments, New York students in grades 3-8 will spend at least six days taking tests starting in April. More states adopting new Common Core assessments expect aggregate testing time to increase, some reaching as high as ten hours.\xc2\xa0\nAccording to guidelines that de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s DOE recently released, \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle should respect the parents\xe2\x80\x99 decision\xe2\x80\x9d in opt-out cases. Students would face no direct consequences, though they may be disadvantaged when applying to selective high schools and gifted programs that use test scores in admissions. And although no schools in New York have been punished for test refusal, some principals, afraid for their funding, have reportedly pressured opt-out students to change their minds.\nTesting aside, parents and educators fear that the standards are developmentally inappropriate, especially in younger grades. The standards cite a range of established research, but as Lesley University early childhood education professor Nancy Carlsson-Paige has noted, of the 135 individuals in Common Core development teams, none were K-3 teachers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Common Core contradicts decades\xe2\x80\x99 worth of child development theory and research that helps us understand how young children learn,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlsson-Paige says. She worries that the test-driven focus on concrete standards \xe2\x80\x9cwill be responsible for influencing pedagogy toward more direct instruction, much less experiential, multidimensional learning in early grades,\xe2\x80\x9d by crowding out hands-on learning and play and consequently hampering imagination and curiosity.\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindergartens today don\xe2\x80\x99t look like they did a few years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlsson-Paige says. \xe2\x80\x9cClassrooms for young kids have really become much more factories for learning standards than the kind of multidimensional learning we know works.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMore broadly, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much to indicate that introducing newer, higher standards as a stand-alone policy necessarily reduces learning gaps or makes students any better at reading and math. In a paper sometimes cited (ill-advisedly) by Common Core advocates, Joshua Goodman of Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Kennedy School of Government found that in every state studied, \xe2\x80\x9cchanges in the quality of standards have little impact on overall student achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nThat hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped states from bringing the Common Core to the vast majority of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 50 million public school pupils. Within this whole, the ranks of families opting out are miniscule, but their movement carries more water politically than their numbers would suggest.\nParents in Long Island, rallying around a 16,000-strong Long Island Opt Out Facebook group, have pushed State Senator Dean Skelos to co-sign a call for a two-year Common Core moratorium. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter having spent months listening to parents, teachers, administrators and educational professionals at public hearings,\xe2\x80\x9d GOP majority leader Skelos announced, he had \xe2\x80\x9cgrave concerns over this flawed rollout\xe2\x80\x9d of the standards.\nTest resistance is already taking shape elsewhere. Teachers in two Chicago schools boycotted state exams this year, with backing from the progressive Chicago Teachers Union. District authorities in Worcester, Mass., recently affirmed the right of parents to opt their kids out of Core-aligned tests.\nEveryone involved in the opt-out movement sees a bumper crop in store. According to Cauthen, the Common Core \xe2\x80\x9cis absolutely fueling the opt-out movement.\xe2\x80\x9d Change the Stakes predicts at least three times more opt-outs in New York City this year compared to last, a total that may approach a thousand students. Slekar foresees something larger: an \xe2\x80\x9cEducation Spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nWhite Suburban Moms?\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an apparent wrinkle in the coalition, though.\nFacing pushback on the Common Core, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan snickered last fall that it was only \xe2\x80\x9cwhite suburban moms,\xe2\x80\x9d afraid of unflattering test results, who composed the Common Core rebellion.\xc2\xa0\nWere it just a flub, the comment wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sparked the firestorm it did. But it contained a kernel of truth that made some deeply uncomfortable.\xc2\xa0\nThe anti-testing contingent spans the political spectrum. Mostly white Tea Partiers who cast the Common Core as big-government overreach have pushed deep-red states like Georgia and Indiana to delay implementation or withdraw from Core-aligned test coalitions. The progressive flank of the movement also skews white, though. Change the Stakes\xe2\x80\x99 Cauthen notes that opt-out parents in New York tend to come from the professional class, concomitant with a whiter demographic. In the past, schools with opt-out activity, though diverse, skewed disproportionately white. But an increasingly diverse pool of opt-out schools are emerging. For instance,\xc2\xa0 the predominantly black and Latino PS 446 in Brownsville has a strong contingent of third graders opting out this year.\nStill could it be that Arne Duncan, who once mused that the Common Core was \xe2\x80\x9camong the most important things to happen to public education in America since Brown vs. Board of Education,\xe2\x80\x9d put a pie in the face of the opt-out movement?\nKarran Harper Royal is no fan of the standards-based reform movement. An advocate for children with disabilities and New Orleans public school parent for more than 20 years, she\xe2\x80\x99s seen her struggling district transform after Hurricane Katrina into a fractured system of school choice where 91 percent of children attend privately-managed charters.\xc2\xa0\nRoyal has seen \xe2\x80\x9ctwo different school experiences\xe2\x80\x9d in the course of her two sons\xe2\x80\x99 educational careers. \xe2\x80\x9cI was able to see the quality of the work and the quality of material covered over time from my first son,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cStandardized testing over the last 15 years has served to dumb down public education. It\xe2\x80\x99s narrowed down to what is on this test.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nBut she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be opting out any time soon. Though she supports Common Core resistance, she says, \xe2\x80\x9chere in New Orleans it\xe2\x80\x99s not the greatest area of concern.\xe2\x80\x9d In a city facing a class-action lawsuit over discrimination against children with disabilities, and a state under Department of Justice investigation for impeding desegregation, \xe2\x80\x9cmost parents just don\xe2\x80\x99t see danger in the Common Core.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nMoreover, some elements of the opt-out movement seem to preclude it from becoming a racial justice project. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see me, as an African-American mom, aligning myself with the Tea Party,\xe2\x80\x9d Royal says.\xc2\xa0\nJose Luis Vilson, an author and New York public school teacher who \xe2\x80\x9ctotally agrees with the movement to opt out of testing,\xe2\x80\x9d echoes this sentiment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m black, I\xe2\x80\x99m Latino,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with me, you need to consider me your equal.\xe2\x80\x9d The Tea Party, with its spurts of racism and overt hatred toward a black president, makes for a bit too odd a bedfellow.\xc2\xa0\nAnd test-based sanctions have been rattling schools in communities of color for years. When low test scores doom a school to closure, it\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelmingly black and Latino kids who are sent packing. The students of Chicago schools closed last summer were 87 percent black, compared to 43 percent of the whole district. As Vilson says, the testing \xe2\x80\x9cbecame a tool by which you could castigate people, castigate entire neighborhoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the era of accountability, black and Latino students have lost far more arts and music than their white peers. According to Americans for Arts, less than a third of black and Latino children now receive a full arts education, and the number is slipping.\xc2\xa0\nWhat Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgaffe\xe2\x80\x9d indicates is that, with public education systems in communities of color already in upheaval, the standards-based reform machine must now lurch toward middle- and upper-middle class enclaves.\nIf the Common Core aims \xe2\x80\x9cto continue to prove the failing schools narrative\xe2\x80\x9d in previously impervious communities, as Slekar supposes, it\xe2\x80\x99s already working. Test scores have cratered in states that already implemented Common Core exams. New York saw its Common Core trial run last year sink scores by about 30 points, just as education officials like Commissioner John King predicted.\nThis is the \xe2\x80\x9ctrain wreck\xe2\x80\x9d that education reform champion Jeb Bush anticipated in 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cMy guess is there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of people running for cover,\xe2\x80\x9d he warned. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, noted last year that Common Core advocates \xe2\x80\x9cexpect the results to mobilize suburban and middle-class parents to the cause of education reform.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCommon Core resistance reflects an awareness of the metastasis of standards-based reforms into broader swaths of the American school system. \xe2\x80\x9cThe changes in public education beginning to touch suburban communities, white or black\xe2\x80\x9d says Royal, \xe2\x80\x9chave touched us already in urban communities.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nOpt-out parents like Brooklyn New School parent Elsass, who is white, acknowledges this dynamic. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re somewhat insulated from what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at other schools,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, citing Brooklyn campuses where arts have been eclipsed by test-focused instruction. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pushing us down a bad road for education.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThere is a silver lining, though.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is a step farther on the path to total privatization of our health care system, not towards the health care system that most Americans support: single payer Medicare for all.\nIn the months leading up to the March 31 deadline to obtain health insurance, ACA supporters united around their mission to enroll people. Volunteers knocked on doors and tabled in their communities. Celebrities and athletes tweeted and labor unions ran robocalls. The media buzzed with speculation about whether the ACA would succeed or fail. March 31 felt like election night. And after it was over, ACA supporters clapped each other on the back and celebrated.\nObamacare survived. But now that the law is implemented and the dust is settling, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to question what this actually means for health care and what we should do now.\nBefore President Obama was elected in 2008, Drs. David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, two of the co-founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, raised a crucial question in their report, \xe2\x80\x9cOur Health Care System at the Crossroads: Single Payer or Market Reform?\xe2\x80\x9d They outlined the health care crisis and how past reforms were taking us toward increasingly \xe2\x80\x9cthreadbare insurance coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d Knowing that health care reform would be front and center for the next few years, they argued that as a nation, we had a choice to make. We could stay on the same path toward a market-based health care system or take an evidence-based approach and create national single payer health insurance.\nWith the ACA, we have now passed that crossroads and are headed down the road to a completely market-based system of privatized health care. This is not something to celebrate. Dr. Adam Gaffney recently wrote an excellent history in Jacobin on the turn we have taken away from the concepts of universal health care and economic justice to a neoliberal model. We are inundated with market rhetoric telling us how wonderful it is to have the choice of shiny silver insurance in the brand new marketplace. Insurance plans are called products and we are consumers of them.\nThe problem with these public relations messages is that having health insurance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee access to health care and health care doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong in the marketplace. As patients, we do not have a choice of whether or not to purchase health care when we need it. Delaying or avoiding necessary care can and does have serious consequences. And we can\xe2\x80\x99t predict how much health care we will need or when we\xe2\x80\x99ll need it. In a market-based system, profits are the bottom line and people receive only the amount of health care they can afford, not what they need.\nThe ACA is transferring hundreds of billions of public dollars to the private insurance industry to subsidize plans that leave people underinsured, unable to afford care and at risk of financial ruin if they have a serious accident or illness. And even at its best, tens of millions of people will remain without insurance.\nMost of the 7.5 million people who purchased health insurance on the exchanges were already insured. More than 80 percent bought the lower-tier silver, bronze or catastrophic plans with the hope that they would not get sick. These plans have the lowest premiums but require that patients pay thousands of dollars out of pocket before insurance kicks in, and then pay 30 to 40 percent of the cost of covered care. The result is that underinsured people will continue to self-ration, delay or avoid care due to cost, as 80 million of us did in 2012.\nThe ACA includes regulations, but as usual the insurance industry has ways to work around them. Many insurers had caps on out-of-pocket costs waived. Insurers also found a way to \xe2\x80\x9ccherry pick\xe2\x80\x9d the healthiest customers by leaving cancer centers and major medical centers out of their networks. In fact, most of the new plans have narrow and ultra-narrow networks that shift more of the cost of care onto patients because care outside of insurance networks isn\xe2\x80\x99t covered. And while insurance companies cannot drop individuals when they get sick, they can stop selling their plans in areas that don\xe2\x80\x99t make a profit. Some are already doing this, which means the competition that was supposed to emerge did not. Instead, in 515 of the poorest counties in 15 states, only one insurance company is available on the health exchange. And greater consolidation of the health care system is underway through mergers and acquisitions.\nOur public insurances, Medicaid and Medicare, are being increasingly taken over by private insurances in the form of Managed Care Organizations and Medicare Advantage. They compete for the healthiest patients and siphon more of the health dollars for profit, salaries and administration than public insurances. Top advisors to the White House expect our public plans to be rolled into the health exchanges in the near future with subsidies, a plan similar to Congressman Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s voucher proposal.\nNations that treat health care as a public good and not a commodity have universal coverage that costs less and produces better health outcomes. And in polls, some two thirds of Americans support single payer. Now our tasks is to shift the national debate away from how many people have insurance to what type of health care system we support. Efforts to do this are taking place at both state and national levels.\nState efforts to educate and organize for universal health systems are using a human rights framework. This started with the Health Care is a Human Right campaign in Vermont that is working to create universal coverage, and similar organizing is happening in Maine, Pennsylvania and Maryland. An essential component of this organizing model is to develop leadership within communities that are uninsured or underinsured. States such as Washington, Oregon, Colorado and New Mexico also use human rights messaging in their campaigns.\nState health reform faces significant barriers because federal legislation is needed to allow the creation of a state single payer system. However, state campaigns are essential because they push state health policy to be the strongest it can be and build an informed and organized grassroots movement that can also push for solutions at the national level.\nLegislation for single payer health systems exists in Congress. In the House, Congressman John Conyers (D-MI) has introduced HR 676, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act,\xe2\x80\x9d in every session since 2003. So far it has 56 co-sponsors. In late 2013, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced SB 1782, \xe2\x80\x9cThe American Health Security Act,\xe2\x80\x9d in the Senate. National organizations are working together to encourage more members to sponsor them and a national lobby day is happening in Washington, D.C., on May 22.\nOn a personal level, I have chosen to be a conscientious objector to the ACA. I cannot in good conscience give my support to the very industry I am trying to eliminate. Being a conscientious objector is a decision that people have to make for themselves. So far nearly 500 people have joined me by signing a petition at PopularResistance.org.\nSome people speculate that the ACA will bring us to single payer some day because it will fail. This will only happen if we fight for it. Every day that we delay, people suffer and die in this country unnecessarily. Neil H. Buchanan says it best, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ACA is as good as it gets, when it comes to basing a health care system on private insurance, and it is simply not good enough. Even as the ACA takes effect, therefore, we need to start planning to make it disappear.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMargaret Flowers is a pediatrician and co-chair of the Maryland chapter of Physicians for a National Health Plan.

We\xe2\x80\x99re saying enough of that!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosa Lozano defiantly announced at an April 5 protest in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, where hundreds had gathered to mark the record number of removals. The milestone was especially galling because President Obama has argued he had to increase immigration enforcement before he could deliver comprehensive immigration reform.\nFor Lozano, and millions of immigrants and their loved ones who face deportation, patience has run out.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be silent, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to stop marching, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to stop participating in acts of civil disobedience,\xe2\x80\x9d Lozano continued, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil Obama takes us seriously and uses his executive order to give our communities relief, because we know that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need Congress for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d Lozano is largely referring to the growing number of immigrants who are coming out of the shadows to join marches, direct actions and hunger strikes. And \xe2\x80\x9crelief\xe2\x80\x9d is now more immediate than the much-debated path to citizenship.\nThe call is for Obama to take actions that would stop deportations, for example, of anyone who would be eligible for citizenship under the immigration reform bill that passed in the Senate last year. Or he could extend a memo he signed in June 2012 called \xe2\x80\x9cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\xe2\x80\x9d which halts the pending removal of young people who came to the United States as children and have been in school or the military. Another option is to end the Secure Communities program that Bush began but Obama expanded, in order to target so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d Recent figures show two-thirds of those deported under Obama committed only minor infractions, such as traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all.\nThe April 5 rally where Lozano spoke was one of 80 events held nationwide that day, organized and largely attended by immigrants and their allies, under the slogan, \xe2\x80\x9cNot One More.\xe2\x80\x9d It was followed by the launch of a rotating hunger strike at the doorstep of the White House.\nBehind the Walls\nMany of these actions have been spurred on by a rise in resistance behind bars \xe2\x80\x94 from those directly facing deportation. Far from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, hundreds have rallied in support of the migrants on hunger strike inside the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington. Weekly vigils during which supporters read messages sent out by detainees are held outside the center.\nMora Villalpando, a Tacoma activist and undocumented immigrant with the group Latino Advocacy, told Free Speech Radio News that the hunger strikers serve as real-life examples of how current immigration policies divide families, and their goal is to change the discourse around the issue of immigration reform. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re doing this for their children because they want their children to see that, although they might be deported, they fought. First, to have their children live better lives, but now they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting to keep families together.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMany of those protesting inside the Northwest Detention Center, which is run by the private prison company Geo Group, have been placed in solitary confinement as punishment, prompting a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped the tactic from spreading. Similar hunger strikes have been confirmed at detention centers in Eloy, Arizona, as well as in El Paso and Conroe, Texas.\nWhen Manuel Martinez, one of the hunger strikers in Conroe, was deported, his daughter and wife traveled from Houston to Washington, D.C., to join the rolling hunger strike in front of the White House.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dad is my hero and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever I have to so he can be home again,\xe2\x80\x9d explained 13-year-old Melanie Martinez.\nOn the same day she arrived, 19 people were arrested outside a detention center in Boston when they chained themselves together to block the facility\xe2\x80\x99s entrance. One of them addressed his speech to President Obama in a video that was posted online and went viral.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tearing us apart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Andr\xc3\xa9s del Castillo. \xe2\x80\x9cI direct that message directly to the president of the United States of America, Barack Obama! That is to you, as a son of an immigrant! As a son of someone else that comes from a different land, you should know better than any that we deserve rights, that we deserve dignity, and you should be recognizing our families!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs The Indypendent went to press, the Obama administration announced it may take steps to limit deportations of immigrants without serious criminal records. The response, says Pablo Alvarado, head of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, came \xe2\x80\x9cbecause suffering is speaking. Affected communities have protested. They have marched. They have engaged in direct civil disobedience. And as a consequence, they have made sure that the end of deportation becomes Plan A. So the question now is not whether the president will act; it\xe2\x80\x99s when will he do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRen\xc3\xa9e Feltz is a producer and criminal justice correspondent for Democracy Now!.\n'",b'\n',"b'May 2, 2014'","b'Roberto Lovato has been immersed in the struggles of this country\xe2\x80\x99s Latino immigrants for more than a quarter century. The son of El Salvadoran immigrants, Lovato headed the Central American Refugee Center during the 1990s and co-founded Presente.org after the mass immigrant rights marches of 2006. There, he built a hub for online Latino political advocacy. In 2009, he designed and led the nationwide Basta Dobbs campaign that forced CNN to drop the notorious Latino-bashing television host Lou Dobbs from its lineup.\nA prolific writer and commentator, Lovato\xe2\x80\x99s work has appeared in an array of English and Spanish-language newspapers and websites. With the number of deportations carried out by the current administration estimated to have recently surpassed 2 million, he has developed another pressure campaign \xe2\x80\x94 the Obama Immigration Legacy Project \xe2\x80\x94 which is working to channel the Latino community\xe2\x80\x99s growing anger over continued deportations directly at the President and force him to shift to a more humane and positive course. There have been some early signs that this more confrontational approach is having an impact on the White House (see page 10). For Lovato, it\xe2\x80\x99s simple: judge your erstwhile friends and allies not by what they say but by what they do.\nJohn Tarleton: Democrats and Republicans are blaming each other as a comprehensive immigration reform bill has stalled once again in Congress. Yet, you say this initiative was never meant to succeed.\nRoberto Lovato: The \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d for comprehensive immigration reform began around 10 years ago. Since then, we have seen all manner of excuses from both Democrats and Republicans for lack of action while the situation of immigrants has sunk to the lowest state in our lifetimes. Under Obama, 2 million mostly Latino people have been deported, most of whom are innocents who have no criminal record.\nMost people in the Latino community didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize Obama was on his way to being the worst immigration president until he was in the White House for five years. A major reason why has to do with how \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration reform\xe2\x80\x9d was used by the Democratic Party to divert attention to the legislative branch and the Republicans and away from the dastardly doings in the executive branch. But, the votes needed to pass immigration reform were never there in Congress. As a result, \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive immigration reform\xe2\x80\x9d has become the new Mexican sombrero of Latino politics. Politicians of all stripes think they can get Latinos to vote for them by mouthing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive immigration reform\xe2\x80\x9d just as they used to wear a sombrero or call out \xe2\x80\x9cViva Cinco de Mayo!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cViva Cesar Chavez!\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s why I call this the \xe2\x80\x9cSi Se Pedo\xe2\x80\x9d (Yes, We Fart) politic; it sounds like something good until you get close and spend time with it.\nJT: Obama and his supporters argue that he\xe2\x80\x99s just enforcing existing immigration laws and that Republicans are thwarting his desired changes.\nRL: Somehow Obama has enforced the very same laws as Bush in a way that has led to a doubling of the rate of deportations. Were it Bush or some other politician, we would be calling it travesty and a disgrace and storming the White House. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s immigration madness began in 2009, back when just a lonely few of us were sounding the alarm. Now the majority of Latinos is alarmed and fed up.\nJT: There was so much momentum at the time of the historic immigrant rights marches of 2006. What happened?\nRL: After the 2006 marches, the Bush administration stepped up raids and deportations by the Department of Homeland Security to put the hammer down on the immigrant community and make people afraid to step out and protest.\nThe second thing that happened after 2006 was the acceleration of a multi-million conglomerate known as \xe2\x80\x9cComprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR).\xe2\x80\x9d Even the most liberal versions of CIR promised to exacerbate all the worst parts of the failed immigration system. Knowing this, a cabal of interests including major foundations, some big labor unions, big immigrant rights and Latino organizations in Washington, D.C., and the Democratic Party all came together around immigration reform and designed their efforts to channel the energy of 2006 into support for the Democratic Party. This produced overwhelming cries of \xe2\x80\x9cSi Se Puede\xe2\x80\x9d and Latino support for Obama in 2008 and again in 2012.\nThis worked for a long time until those of us on the left wing of the immigrant rights movement like the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, left-leaning DREAMers, Detention Watch Network, Presente.org and many local groups started exposing the hypocrisy of Obama and the Democrats.\nJT: Following Bush and now with Obama, to what extent do we have an immigration industrial complex composed of state officials and private interests that are entrenched around the current status quo?\nRL: There is a bipartisan interest in maintaining systems of isolation, control and repression of Latino and immigrant communities. The immigration industrial complex was born of a Democrat, Bill Clinton, expanded by George Bush and given steroids and a robocop outfit by Barack Obama. This complex, first analyzed by Deepa Fernandes and I, consists of politicians from both parties and local communities that live off of and vote for policies and money for jailing immigrants. The complex also includes the private prison industry, military and surveillance technology companies among others.\nJT: Are there other underlying reasons for why the United States has continued militarizing its southern border besides the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a profitable business for private companies to get in on?\nRL: The simple and simplistic \xe2\x80\x94 and wrong \xe2\x80\x94 answer is that Obama and the Democrats are playing \xe2\x80\x9ctough\xe2\x80\x9d to win votes in Congress and in elections. Top migration and climate scientists will tell you another story, the story of how something on the order of a billion people on this planet are potentially going to be uprooted by climate change in this century. They will travel to the north from the south, which is going to absorb the brunt of climate change as we are already beginning to see. South-to-north migration is also occurring not only in the Americas but in Asia and in Europe where they are putting up border walls with lots of boats and weapons in the waters between Africa and Europe. Even southern countries in Latin America have their own \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration problems.\xe2\x80\x9d Criminalizing immigrants is an excuse to militarize the border in preparation for millions of people marching north because of climate change. Other explanations are insufficient at best and diversionary lies at worst.\nJT: How much does racism account for the anti-immigrant backlash?\nRL: There\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a racial dimension. I went to Arizona about a decade ago when the Minutemen were conducting self-styled border patrols. I found ex-farmers who had been globalized out of existence by big agribusiness, industrial workers whose factories had moved away from Arizona, military people who lost their jobs following Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s downsizing of the military. The appeal to white fear makes a lot of sense to these abandoned workers who wanted an explanation for what was happening to them. It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier for politicians to say \xe2\x80\x9cthem immigrants took your jobs\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9cyour jobs got evaporated by capitalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\nJT: What would you want immigration reform to look like?\nRL: The first true measure now of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to immigrants is to stop the deportations. The immigrant condition has been so degraded that we have to start there. Anything else, including \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive immigration reform,\xe2\x80\x9d is a farce. When you hear National Council of La Raza and others saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Republicans have to support comprehensive immigration,\xe2\x80\x9d they are not being sincere. They are playing with people\xe2\x80\x99s lives to protect the Democrats. Important next steps should include ending programs like Secure Communities that make mass deportations possible and a more aggressive use of executive powers by Obama to halt deportations. Without forcing changes the Executive, the Democrats and Republicans will continue foot-dragging on legalization and other major changes.\nJT: Is there a way to work with the Democrats going forward?\nRL: The best way to deal with the Democrats or any party is from a position of autonomous power. We have to do everything in our power to free the immigrant rights movement from the Democratic Party. The great tragedy in immigrant rights is not just Republican hostility toward immigrants, but the cynical calculations that humiliated and turned the immigrant rights movement and Latino electoral power into an appendage of the Democratic Party. The moment we started down that road was the moment we lost our way. The \xe2\x80\x9cstrategists\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cleaders\xe2\x80\x9d at D.C. groups that have received hundreds of millions of dollars in funding since 2004 have nothing, nada, to show for it except a worsened immigrant condition and a humiliated Latino politics that was subservient to the Democratic Party until this year.\nAn independent immigrant rights movement means we can unite and begin the necessary fight against the criminal justice system that makes immigrant rights a criminal justice issue. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do it alone in our silos, so why not work together? This is where our energy needs to be, not in the Democratic Party.\nJT: After all these years, you are still hopeful?\nRL: As hopeful as ever. The Latino and immigrant communities are fired up and awake like they were in 2006 \xe2\x80\x94 and then some. I feel like the hummingbird that can sense the dawn coming even though it\xe2\x80\x99s completely dark.

Socialist candidate Kshama Sawant\xe2\x80\x99s successful City Council campaign tore through Seattle politics, leaving the 1% paralyzed and unable to cope with a movement they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen coming. The Seattle elite had no way to counter her arguments, silence her supporters or keep her from gathering a tidal wave of approval for the $15 Now campaign to raise the minimum wage.\nBut Sawant\xe2\x80\x99s election victory was just the beginning. After singlehandedly transforming city politics, Sawant used her newly elected bully pulpit to torment the mayor and City Council and harangue Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s corporations, while simultaneously mobilizing thousands in the streets to ram through her progressive agenda. The corporate elite didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. They conceded defeat and agreed to a $15 per hour minimum wage \xe2\x80\x94 in rhetoric.\nSawant didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it, refusing to declare victory until it was in her hands. After the mayor and the City Council created a committee to implement the $15 minimum wage, Sawant was sounding the alarm bells, correctly predicting that such a radical change would never be accepted without a fight by Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy, who would eventually recover from their shell shock and re-group to attack.\nThat attack is now beginning. But a direct assault isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible yet. Sawant\xe2\x80\x99s position is fortified by her broad-based support. Thus, the 1% are playing a long game, using a combination of tried-and-true tactics, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x9cagree\xe2\x80\x9d to Sawant\xe2\x80\x99s demands on one hand while slandering her as an \xe2\x80\x9cextremist\xe2\x80\x9d on the other, all the while proposing a plan for a $15 wage with just enough loopholes to render it meaningless. For example, the corporations want a $15 wage that includes \xe2\x80\x9ctotal compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that the costs of any benefit \xe2\x80\x94 like health insurance \xe2\x80\x94 could be counted as part of a worker\xe2\x80\x99s salary, thus changing the definition of minimum wage.\nThese are some of the tactics being employed by the newly-formed Seattle corporate front group \xe2\x80\x9cOne Seattle,\xe2\x80\x9d whose members include some of the largest corporations in the world. Another one of the group\xe2\x80\x99s strategies is to create the illusion of a middle ground between themselves and Sawant. Since \xe2\x80\x9cmom and pop\xe2\x80\x9d are more lovable than Starbucks\xe2\x80\x99 multimillionaire CEO, they intend to use middle-class small business owners as proxies in the war.\nThis plan to win the hearts and minds of the public by putting forward the friendly face of small business owners was recently exposed by the Stranger, a weekly Seattle newspaper, which revealed a leaked One Seattle memo that detailed the \xe2\x80\x9csmall business strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as other aforementioned tactics that Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s biggest corporations were going to use to undermine Sawant and the $15 Now campaign.\nBut One Seattle is still playing defense against Sawant, who continues to show no hint of mercy. Having predicted that the City Council would stall, Sawant and $15 Now have been threatening to go over the heads of the Council by organizing a public ballot measure initiative.\nThe Seattle elites are terrified of the ballot initiative. One of the City Council members who claims to be in favor of $15 complained, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate the idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re pressured to make a decision [about $15] because of the ballot threat.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis quote reveals, in small part, the inherent power of the demand: it\xe2\x80\x99s gathered such broad support that politicians are forced to react, and none dare to oppose it. It\xe2\x80\x99s also forced politicians and corporate hacks to debate the demand publicly, extending the reach of the issue to working people all over Seattle.\nThe campaign inspires confidence in working people, who for decades have been taught to act defensively, if at all. $15 Now is the first time in years that working people have gone on the offensive. This is precisely the type of confidence that union workers need in order to demand higher wages at the bargaining table, and the type of self-assurance that non-union workers need to demand a $15 minimum wage and a union.\nIt is also a demand that will make a huge difference in the lives of working people on the low end of the wage scale. It will help unite the working class by bringing the bottom up closer to the rest of the class, it will help reduce growing wealth inequality and it will help unions recruit by demonstrating that they can play a significant, positive role in the lives of working people.\nBut this battle can\xe2\x80\x99t be limited to Seattle. Fortunately, groups across the country are adopting the $15 demand. A $15 minimum wage victory was won in SeaTac, Washington, at the end of 2013, and activists and progressive lawmakers are making strides on the issue in Davis, California, Chicago and New York City. Another front opened in the battle when Sawant spoke in Portland on April 24, and it came alongside the recently announced offensive in San Francisco, where SEIU 1021 announced that they would also pursue a $15 ballot measure.\nThe ultimate success of the $15 demand will depend on the energy, organization and resources dedicated by labor and community groups, combined with the mobilization of the broader community. Do we have it in us to go on the offensive, as Sawant has?\nThis article was adapted from an earlier version that appeared on commondreams.org.\n'",b'\n',"b'June 12, 2014'","b""Men often do things that make women feel uncomfortable, or worse. Following the shootings in Isla Vista, California on May 23 \xe2\x80\x94 perpetrated by Elliot Rodger, a young man with a deeply misogynistic worldview \xe2\x80\x94 thousands of women took to Twitter to speak out about their experiences of fear, harassment and gender-based violence under the hashtag #YesAllWomen. The sentiments expressed are well summarized in this tweet by @AdelaideKane: \xe2\x80\x9cNot ALL men harass women. But ALL women have, at some point, been harassed by men. Food for thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWithin just a few days, #YesAllWomen had gotten over a million tweets. In their totality, the 140-character testimonies detail the presence of deep-seated and systemic violence against women in the United States and beyond. Male responses have included, as might be expected, ones of vitriol (see #NotAllMen) but also ones of solidarity and support, written under the spin-off hashtag #AllMenCan. Here are some of the most poignant comments.\n@sharpegirl\n\tBecause I wore a fake wedding ring when I waitressed. \xe2\x80\x9cBelonging\xe2\x80\x9d to another man was the only way to get customers to back off. #YesAllWomen\n@stack2thefuture\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d like to recommend every guy read the #YesAllWomen posts.

Bader\n""",b'\n',"b'June 12, 2014'","b'Elliot Rodger\xe2\x80\x99s attacks in California sparked a feminist outcry about sexism, misogyny and sexual violence. But that frustration has been building since long before the Isla Vista shootings, perhaps nowhere as acutely as on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s college campuses. Universities have proven themselves ill-equipped to keep students safe, and failing that, to provide victims with a sense of justice after an assault. Many schools are now squirming in the limelight as a result.\xc2\xa0\nA grassroots campaign for colleges to reform their policies, led mostly by female students and alumni, has been quietly but steadily building for more than a year. Women have increasingly been speaking out about their personal experiences with assault on campuses, connecting with one another and taking legal action under Title IX, the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex discrimination at institutions that receive federal funds. Sixty-one colleges are now under investigation by the Education Department for possible Title IX violations related to sexual violence.\nOne of the women who have gone public with their stories is Emma Sulkowicz, a senior at Columbia University studying visual arts. In 2012, she was raped by a fellow student on campus. Eight months later, she decided to report it to the university, and a year after that, she went public. In disciplinary hearings, the Columbia administration found her attacker not guilty; as far as she knows, he will be returning to campus in the fall, after a semester abroad. But she and other women activists have gained the ear of the White House and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and are working to force college administrators\xe2\x80\x99 hands on the issue. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a building wave,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow the wave is breaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nAlina Mogilyanskaya: You\xe2\x80\x99re in a summer art residency right now. What kind of work are you doing there?\nEmma Sulkowicz: After all of this, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself in the same way anymore. Before my story was very private, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s in the public eye. Now, people will come up to me and tell me either that what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing is very brave or that I\xe2\x80\x99m a slut and a liar. All of my interactions with people have changed and my relationship to the subject of rape has changed. A lot of my work here has been trying to figure out how to make artwork with this new identity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a weird thing because I\xe2\x80\x99m so tired of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of having to think about it yet it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about.\xc2\xa0\nAM: What made you decide to speak out in the first place?\nES: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to deal with it at first. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. But then I met another woman who said that the same person who had raped me had engaged with intimate partner violence with her over an extended period of time. And we ended up meeting another woman who\xe2\x80\x99d been raped by him. I realized that the longer I stayed silent, the longer he would be free to assault other people on campus. That\xe2\x80\x99s when these women and I decided to come forward.\nAM: What happened the night of the assault? And what has it been like to come to terms with it?\nES: My attacker was one of my closest friends at the time, and we\xe2\x80\x99d had consensual sex twice in the past. There was a party and we left together. I invited him to my room because we\xe2\x80\x99d had sex before, and we were having consensual vaginal intercourse. Soon though, he hit me across the face and started choking me and pinned my arms behind my head and pushed my legs up against my chest. He began to anally penetrate me. It was really painful and I was saying no, I was telling him to stop but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Then finally he did, he got off and laid down next to me for a second. I was just frozen solid. I was petrified. And then he ran out.\xc2\xa0\nI spent months in denial. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to believe that I\xe2\x80\x99d been raped because realizing that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been raped is realizing that people can take control of you and objectify you. In that moment, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a human to him. I was just a thing. And that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty fucking scary. Once I finally did admit to myself that it had happened, I was really unhappy. And I think a lot of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with since then is trying to find ways to believe that I am human.\xc2\xa0\nAM: How has it affected your outlook on sexuality?\nES: I identify as a straight woman. I have an amazing boyfriend who has been so essential in my recovery. But even now, there are some things that I have to set limits for. Like even if his hand is near my throat, I will freak out, even though I know he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to hurt me. So I have to set boundaries. There are certain areas of my body that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think will ever be able to be touched ever again.\xc2\xa0\nAM: While they\xe2\x80\x99re expected to comply with Title IX, colleges have the discretion to develop their own procedures for investigating sexual assault cases. What was it like dealing with the Columbia administration after you decided to report the rape?\nES: It was incredibly frustrating. I was interviewed by the Title IX investigator, and she took incomplete and inaccurate notes, where she excluded extremely important details and made mistakes about others. Then I went before a panel of administrators who were supposed to be trained on the issue, but they were not. One lady was asking me, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it possible that anal rape could happen if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have lubrication?\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there was force involved and that\xe2\x80\x99s the definition of rape.\xe2\x80\x9d But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wrap her mind around it.\xc2\xa0\nThere were other issues too. If I had a penny for every blatant attempt that the school made to try to keep me silent, I would be so rich. I got so many phone calls from the administration saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to talk about confidentiality.\xe2\x80\x9d I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to talk to the other women who\xe2\x80\x99d been assaulted by the same person, and they gave me rules about what I was allowed to say to my friends.\xc2\xa0\nBefore, I believed in the system. I believed that by coming out and reporting what had happened, it would somehow do something good for the world. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that the system wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working. The moment I got the email saying that he was not guilty was earth-shattering, because I realized that there was no one for me to turn to that would help keep us safe.\xc2\xa0\nAM: Columbia says that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken steps to address the issue. For instance, administrators have added another Title IX investigator. They\xe2\x80\x99ve eased the confidentiality process for victims who are reporting these cases. They are going to be increasing consent education. Is that enough?\nES: I believe that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking the kinds of steps where they can say they\xe2\x80\x99re doing something without doing much at all. At the end of the day, my rapist is still here and I think that all these steps are just going to be sort of asinine until they fix the real problem. I think they should give survivors that have rapists on campus the opportunity to reopen their cases.\xc2\xa0\nThere are two main activist groups at Columbia working on the issue, the Coalition Against Sexual Violence and the No Red Tape group, and I have been involved with both. We put together a list of policy demands \xe2\x80\x94 to better train the administrators involved in these decisions, to allow serial rape as evidence, and many others \xe2\x80\x94 but the administration has yet to take the suggestions into consideration.\nAM: This issue has exploded on other campuses \xe2\x80\x94 Amherst, Tufts, Harvard, Brown, the list goes on and on. How does it feel to see this issue come to the fore in so many other places, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step?\nES: I feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s been a building wave and now the wave is breaking. It\xe2\x80\x99s really exciting. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping that if we can get enough strength this time around, we\xe2\x80\x99ll actually make some lasting change. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to each other across campuses and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking each other for advice. One of our biggest next steps is to try to make this more of an inter-school conversation rather than just a Columbia one. Here, meanwhile, the administration promised that they would work on our policy suggestions over the summer. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to see if they stay true to their word. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep fighting.\xc2\xa0\nAM: You mentioned lasting change. What would you like to see done on a national level?\nES: Rape happens off college campuses as well. One of the most egregious examples is the way the police handle rape: it\xe2\x80\x99s atrocious. When I finally reported my rape to the police, an officer straight up told me that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raped. He was not in a position to say that to me, yet he felt the need to. The last thing you need after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been raped is to be re-traumatized by people who are telling you your experience didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen before it\xe2\x80\x99s even been investigated.\nOne thing I would love to come from this movement is a broader awareness about what sexual assault really means. And I want survivors who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the United States and who aren\xe2\x80\x99t at colleges to start to see some validation of these experiences in their lives.\nThis conversation is excerpted from a longer interview with Emma Sulkowicz.\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n#YesAllWomen, by Alina Mogilyanskaya\nNow All Men, by Nicholas Powers\nExplained, by Eleanor J. Bader\n'",b'\n',"b'June 12, 2014'","b'""I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you girls aren\xe2\x80\x99t attracted to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said into the camera. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will punish you all for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe next day, on May 24, news headlines said that a young man named Elliot Rodger in Isla Vista, California, drove around stabbing and shooting until six people were dead. He crashed his car and shot himself dead, leaving families to mourn slain loved ones. And he left behind a 137-page autobiographical manifesto and a collection of YouTube videos; in one entitled Retribution, he said to women: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you don\xe2\x80\x99t see in me. I\xe2\x80\x99m the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMisogyny: the hatred of women. It is the emotional atmosphere of a patriarchal society that, like an acidic fog, burns everyone. We breathe it, walk in it, make our lives inside it, forgetting it\xe2\x80\x99s there until loud gunfire comes from a man like Rodger, who is now the face of male supremacy. But after he fades from the news, we will still be left with ongoing violence against women. More than three American women a day are killed by a current or former intimate partner. In 2010, 85,593 women were raped in the United States: that\xe2\x80\x99s 235 a day, and because rape is markedly underreported, even those numbers are low. Women still contend with a wage gap and a glass ceiling. In the Global South, at least 150 million girls have had their genitals sheared off as a \xe2\x80\x9crite of passage.\xe2\x80\x9d Women will still be sex-trafficked. And of course, women are killed before birth; over 90 million were aborted in India and China because parents did not want the burden of a girl.\nIn the United States, women saw in Rodger\xe2\x80\x99s misogynist killing spree an extreme form of the violence they live with every day. The Twitter hashtag #YesAllWomen became a public forum for sharing stories of male violence, spanning from microaggressions to rape. Yet many of us men can\xe2\x80\x99t see ourselves in Rodger. Or read the stories of women\xe2\x80\x99s fear or anger or hurt without laughing (yes, I heard men laughing about it on the subway) or dismissing it as the hysterics of overly sensitive women. We choose not to listen because if we did, it would destroy our self-image, by showing how women too often see us: as tormentors, oblivious and arrogant, who cause pain they are too scared or tired or too hopeless to even talk about.\xc2\xa0\nBoys Will Be Boys\nWhy are we killing women? I know, I know. An instant defensive wall rises in the brain. I\xe2\x80\x99m not hurting women, I don\xe2\x80\x99t gun them down or rape or harass them. Nor do my boys. It\xe2\x80\x99s not all men!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all men, it\xe2\x80\x99s not you. Relax. You\xe2\x80\x99re off the hook. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Boko Haram or the Black guys on the street corner. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Puerto Ricans during their annual parade. Maybe the Indian men who left two raped girls hanging dead from a tree? Better yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s the medieval Saudis who won\xe2\x80\x99t let women drive. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s always someone else, somewhere else. It will never be you or me.\nAnd yet, every woman I talk to has a story. Every, single one. At Bed-Stuy\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Service Caf\xc3\xa9, I asked two women about sexism. One told me of being paid less than her male boss while doing his work. The other said she pretended to be made of steel in order to not be hurt by sexist comments at her job.\nLater, a friend told me that while drinking at a male friend\xe2\x80\x99s house she blacked out and woke up to find him thrusting inside her. After his orgasm, he got up and asked if his cousin in the next room \xe2\x80\x9ccould get some too.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDuring the New York summer, men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes transform into giant tongues licking women up and down. Participating in everyday guy talk is like passing a pair of scissors around, cutting women into pieces \xe2\x80\x94 nice tits, look at that ass, good dick sucking lips on that one!\nMen say over and over that it\xe2\x80\x99s not all men. And yet seemingly every woman has a story of sexism. What are the mechanics of this social blindness? One is simple displacement. Privileged men project their sexism downward and outward to the faraway \xe2\x80\x9cOther\xe2\x80\x9d who is always more brutal and more savage. In comparison to them, we look like extras from The Bachelor. How can we be sexist? We let you drive and vote!\nAnd then of course there\xe2\x80\x99s denial. We minimize the pain our male privilege causes women. Men are trained in, celebrate and have made industries out of violence. Often, pain is visible only if it\xe2\x80\x99s physical. Yet bodily harm is one pole on the spectrum of violence and making it the only \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d form of sexism renders invisible the thousand small acts of disrespect and aggression that women endure each day. But again there\xe2\x80\x99s that question. How can we be sexist? We didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave any marks!\nFinally, sexism as an ideological practice \xe2\x80\x9cnaturalizes\xe2\x80\x9d itself with nature and religion. Our dominance is part of the evolutionary order, we hunt, we pursue, we spread our seed, we build and destroy; we lead. Women are weak and emotional. Biology is destiny. Or pick your holy book, the Torah, the Bible, the Koran, all written by men, describing a male god who demands that women obey men. Shocker! Of course it leaves women in the impossible position of \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreting\xe2\x80\x9d religious texts that are hopelessly sexist to eke out a moderate form of devotion.\nSexist ideology and practice are reproduced in institutions. The military, the church, Hollywood, sports, Wall Street, wherever all-male spaces exist or where men dominate and women are tokens, sexism builds and spills over. It recreates us in its image. And it recreates itself in how we imagine ourselves.\nNo Homo!\nBoys, ever feel scared you weren\xe2\x80\x99t a man? Ever stand, lonely, on the outside of a circle of men, who laughed with arms slung on each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders? When did you know that a joke about women was the surest way in?\nRemember the crack you made about pussy? How they laughed and brought you into the circle. Once inside, everyone took turns climbing this imagined \xe2\x80\x9cwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d You fucked her brains out, hosed her inner organs with your mighty jizz until they were glazed like porcelain, you came on her face in a total bukkake apocalypse until spent from laughter, you left the circle, knowing you were one of the guys.\nIf in Marxism the commodity is the basic element of capitalism, we can say that in Feminism, objectification is the core process of patriarchy. The turning of a human being into an object that is a tool for your purpose, who has no agency or feelings of her own, a woman interchangeable with other women or a thing you can destroy is the very discursive engine of patriarchy. And it happens because men are not really \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x9d but human beings performing a gender role, acting \xe2\x80\x9cmasculine\xe2\x80\x9d by exchanging objectified images of women.\nWhen men brag about fucking women, they\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly extolling an authentic connection with another human being. More likely, they\xe2\x80\x99re showing off the grade of conquest, her hair, her skin, her body shape. She becomes a trophy we pass around to others. She\xe2\x80\x99s an object, and possessing her proves our manhood to ourselves and to other men.\nIt creates the ugly dynamic of sexual entitlement, in which men believe they are owed women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies. And it cuts both ways. Privileged men feel entitled to sex simply because of their wealth, class or racial status. In his manifesto, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Twisted Life,\xe2\x80\x9d Elliot Rodgers \xe2\x80\x94 who was half-white and half-Asian \xe2\x80\x94 wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cHow could an inferior, ugly black boy be able to get a white girl and not me? I am beautiful, and I am half white myself. I am descended from British aristocracy. He is descended from slaves. I deserve it more.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnderprivileged men, who feel too poor, too inexperienced, too ugly, too not enough are often dangerous. They overcompensate by strong-arming women, dominating or abusing them, attempting to control women they fear they can\xe2\x80\x99t keep otherwise. And then there is the subset of men who are insecure about their masculinity not because they\xe2\x80\x99re broke or ugly or awkward but because they\xe2\x80\x99re not really straight. They sublimate their bisexuality into sexist rituals of objectifying women and attacking gays and transgender people, who represent the very desires they repressed in themselves. These insecurities may be why on an Atlanta train in May, a group of men assaulted two transgender women. They taunted and violently attacked the pair, stripping one of the women naked while bystanders filmed the scene but did not intervene.\xc2\xa0\nA Game of Status\nThe daily control of women is how patriarchy is maintained. On their bruises we map our property. On their silence, we forge our voice. At the core is our need to be a \xe2\x80\x9cman\xe2\x80\x9d for other men, and a woman is a checker piece we use to play a game of status with other men. And we are desperate to know we\xe2\x80\x99re men because at our core, we\xe2\x80\x99re never that sure.\nThere is also a great desire to be free of it. We feel it individually when we are with women we love \xe2\x80\x94 romantic partners, yes, but also our family, our friends, our colleagues. Even the most sexist men will defend women they love, because in their compartmentalized minds a special room exists for real relationships that tether them to reality. And we feel it in social movements when, united for a common cause, we want each other\xe2\x80\x99s greatness to shine. In the Slut March of 2011, in the gay weddings of our friends and family, we experience glimpses of that post-sexist world. When authentic human connection lets the man-mask come off, our whole inner being becomes real again.\xc2\xa0\nNow if we can take what we know from our personal and public lives and make feminism a goal among men, our vision of the world will change. When the photo of the Indian girls, raped, strangled and hung from a tree is in the news, we will see their male killers in the same way we now think of whites, gathered around the body of a lynched Black man, as people sick with a terrible ideology that transforms their fear into cruelty.\nThe first step is incredibly simple \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0LISTEN! Ask the women in your life what their experience of sexism is and as they talk, just shut up. Do you clench up? Do you feel a wall between your mind and her words? Instead of shutting down, use your defense mechanisms as a map to what scares you about their pain and confront it.\xc2\xa0\nSadly, some men won\xe2\x80\x99t listen, and they must be challenged and healed when possible, defeated when not. But the desire to be free of sexism does exist. Leaving the Nostrand subway station the other night, I passed through the turnstile as a man was yelling at a young woman, \xe2\x80\x9cCome here sweet thing. Get your ass over here. Got this for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI saw her ducking her head as if dodging rocks, and then a guy in overalls yelled, \xe2\x80\x9cNigga what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you! Can\xe2\x80\x99t see she want to be left alone.\xe2\x80\x9d A circle of us eyed the asshole sexist. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate motherfuckers like you,\xe2\x80\x9d the man in overalls shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t a man, motherfucker, do that shit to me, come on bitch, say that to me.\xe2\x80\x9d The asshole sexist mumbled some Caribbean gibberish and left as we followed him out with our eyes. And then we looked at each other and I swear we all liked what we saw.\nI looked at the young woman, quickly jogging up the steps. Did she?\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n#YesAllWomen, by Alina Mogilyanskaya\n\'There Was No One For Me To Turn To\', by Alina Mogilyanskaya\nExplained, by Eleanor J.

There\xe2\x80\x99s also serious scholarship here, including an analysis of Virginia Woolf\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of ambiguity and doubt, alongside work meant to inspire social change. It\xe2\x80\x99s a potent and engaging brew, and while some of the essays seem somewhat dated \xe2\x80\x94 six of the pieces were published in TomDispatch, The Financial Times, and Zyzzva Magazine between 2008 and early 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 Solnit\xe2\x80\x99s pull-no-punches observations nonetheless make this a valuable contribution to feminist theory.\nIndeed, the many pontificators who have declared feminism pass\xc3\xa9 need simply read the memoir fragment that became the title essay, \xe2\x80\x9cMen Explain Things to Me,\xe2\x80\x9d to be reminded of their folly. In the piece, Solnit recounts a personal experience: The scene is a genteel dinner party and Solnit, with her friend Sally, is telling the male host about the recent release of her book, River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cut me off after I mentioned Muybridge,\xe2\x80\x9d Solnit begins. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The gent asked.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Very Important,\xe2\x80\x9d she continues, \xe2\x80\x9cwas going on smugly about this book I should have known when Sally interrupted him to say, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s her book.\xe2\x80\x99 Or tried to interrupt him anyway. But he just continued on his way. She had to say, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s her book\xe2\x80\x99 three or four times before he finally took it in\xe2\x80\xa6 And then, he went ashen.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny in a \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d sort of way, but it is also an experience that will resonate with many women. It surely did with me, as I remembered the guy who offered to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d an article I was working on and the man who suggested I read a lot if I wanted to write well.\nWhile it helps to have a sense of humor about some of this, other topics, like the ubiquity of rape, sexual assault and domestic violence, are deadly serious. Solnit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Longest War\xe2\x80\x9d addresses these crimes \xe2\x80\x94 the kinds of assaults that include the recent murder of teenager Maren Sanchez by a male peer in Connecticut and the killings carried out by Elliot Rodger in Isla Vista, California \xe2\x80\x94 and underscores the fact that they are far more likely to be perpetrated by men against women than the reverse. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lives of half of humanity are still dogged by, drained by, and sometimes ended by this pervasive variety of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of how much more time and energy we would have to focus on other things if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t so busy surviving.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOr, imagine, for that matter, not having to fight for marriage equality \xe2\x80\x94 not only in the traditional sense of the term, which denotes same-sex marriage, but in terms of equality between heterosexual partners. In \xe2\x80\x9cIn Praise of the Threat,\xe2\x80\x9d Solnit champions the parity she believes is inherent in LGBTQ relationships. While I would argue that the existence of racial and class hierarchies are as common in same-gender relationships as they are in straight ones, her contention that queer couplings represent an alternative to the rigid gender binary \xe2\x80\x94 one that opens up space for reimagining heterosexual relationships as well \xe2\x80\x94 is both refreshing and hopeful.\nLikewise, her closing essay, \xe2\x80\x9cPandora\xe2\x80\x99s Box and the Volunteer Police Force,\xe2\x80\x9d notes how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come in the past 50 years. Domestic violence is considered a crime; women are visible players in political, social and economic life; bearing children out of wedlock is no longer deemed shameful or even wrong; and the term \xe2\x80\x9crape culture\xe2\x80\x9d has been coined to call attention to society\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions about predatory male behavior.\nAnd our lexicon has recently been expanded. As Solnit wrote on TomDispatch on June 1, the term \xe2\x80\x9csexual entitlement\xe2\x80\x9d has come to the fore since the Isla Vista murders. This attitude, she explains, rests on the assumption that a man has the right to have sex with a woman regardless of what she wants. \xe2\x80\x9cIn other words,\xe2\x80\x9d Solnit wrote, ""his rights trump hers, or she has none.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlthough this is maddening, Solnit nonetheless celebrates the feminist gains that have been made to date and argues that, no matter the backlash, the genie cannot be stuffed back into the bottle. Although I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely convinced \xe2\x80\x94 just look at the Taliban or Nazi rise to power and the immediate suppression they orchestrated \xe2\x80\x94 if her optimism catalyzes a movement to ensure that these gains are maintained and built on, it will be high time to toast the vigilance of those \xe2\x80\x94 like Solnit \xe2\x80\x94 who have made it happen.\nRELATED COVERAGE:\n#YesAllWomen, by Alina Mogilyanskaya\n\'There Was No One For Me To Turn To,\'\xc2\xa0by Alina Mogilyanskaya\nNow All Men, by Nicholas Powers\n'",b'\n',"b'July 16, 2014'","b'In a closely watched case, a California judge ruled on June 10 that the state\xe2\x80\x99s teacher tenure laws infringed on the civil rights of students in schools in poor communities to a proper education guaranteed under the state constitution.\nPointing to evidence that one to three percent of teachers in California\xe2\x80\x99s public schools are grossly ineffective, Judge Rolf Treu wrote in his 16-page decision that teacher tenure laws \xe2\x80\x9cimpose a real and appreciable impact on students\xe2\x80\x99 fundamental right to equality of education and that they impose a disproportionate burden on poor and minority students.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe astroturf parent group that pursued the lawsuit was funded by Silicon Valley millionaire David Welch. While Treu left California tenure laws in place until state appeals courts review his ruling, similar anti-tenure lawsuits have since been filed in several states, including here in New York.\xc2\xa0\nTreu\xe2\x80\x99s ruling also drew a swift reaction from critics who asked why the judge focused his ire exclusively on a small group of allegedly ineffective teachers while ignoring widespread phenomena such as family poverty, lack of adequate school funding and high rates of teacher turnover.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is a violation of the California state constitution to have tenure laws that make it hard to fire bad teachers in poor and minority communities, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a violation when the state and districts draw school boundary lines in a way that promotes deeply unequal, economically segregated schools that many strong educators won\xe2\x80\x99t teach in?\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Richard Kahlenberg, author and editor of numerous books on education policy, at Slate.\nThe unusual nature of the Vergara case was underscored by revelations that some of the nine child plaintiffs attend charter schools where there is no tenure. Elizabeth and Beatriz Vergara (for whom the lawsuit is named) both attend a pilot school in the Los Angeles Unified School District that is free to let teachers go at the end of the school year for any reason, including ineffectiveness. Another plaintiff testified that her teacher Christine McLaughlin was a very bad teacher even though McLaughlin had received the 2013 Teacher of the Year award from the Pasadena (Calif.) Unified School District.\nNot a Lifetime Job Guarantee\nInstead of being framed as a due process issue, teacher tenure has been framed as a lifetime job guarantee by corporate-backed school reformers intent on driving a wedge between parents and teachers. In fact, tenure has existed to prevent politics from entering the classroom and to protect teachers from retribution for well over 100 years, decades before unions even existed or had collective bargaining rights.\xc2\xa0\n\nWhy Tenure Helps Teachers Help Kids\nI taught elementary school at PS 147 in Williamsburg for 27 years. I realized early on that building strong community roots with my students and their parents, all people of color, and fighting for their interests would make me a more successful teacher. That activism led to clashes with a white-controlled local school board. The district, where 90 percent of the students were children of color, was under the political control of my union, the United Federation of teachers (UFT). The political kingpin was the UFT district rep.\nIn 1973, two years after I received tenure, the district superintendent and the UFT representative visited my assistant principal. They both \xe2\x80\x9csuggested\xe2\x80\x9d he give me an unsatisfactory rating for the school year, the first step in forcing me out of my job. My assistant principal refused; he later joked that his hopes of becoming a principal ended that day.\xc2\xa0\nThus I became a fierce defender of tenure and also understood how supervisors could get rid of tenured teachers if they wanted to put some effort into it.\xc2\xa0\nI also went on to fight for the kids inside my school, especially when we got an ambitious principal who used every trick in the book to try to boost test scores. A key was removing as many low-scoring children as possible from the tests. If they were classified in any way as special needs, they could be tested separately and their scores would not be lumped in with the rest of the students\xe2\x80\x99.\xc2\xa0\nOne of the more rambunctious boys I taught received speech therapy for a lisp. When my principal ordered him removed from my class on testing day, I balked. I even called the New York Times to complain and was told, \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t that happen all the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nMy principal also moved against another boy in the class whose apartment had caught fire, forcing his family to move in with a relative in another district a few miles away during the two months it would take to fix their apartment. But he kept coming to class. A few days before the test, I received a note that he had transferred to a school near his relative. The secretary told me the principal had ordered the transfer. She had assumed that he would score low (I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the possible racial implications of her assumption) when in fact I had confidence he would do fine. I fought tooth and nail to keep him and threatened to make a big stink about it. She relented but with these words: He\xe2\x80\x99d better do well on the test. And he did. And I was able to advocate for the kids because I had tenure.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Norm Scott\n\nTenure actually protects children rather than hurts them by allowing teachers to stand up for their interests. In my own school, when a principal tried to get teachers to push children who struggled with reading into special education classes as a way to make the school\xe2\x80\x99s reading scores look better, most teachers were able to resist (see sidebar).\nIn a perfect educational world all teachers would be great and all supervisors would be benign, wise and fair and treat all teachers with respect and consideration. But alas \xe2\x80\x94 that is why there is such a thing as tenure, a fact that was highlighted during Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s 12 years in office.\xc2\xa0\nUnder Bloomberg, the average number of years spent teaching by a New York City school principal dropped from 14 to nine, according to a 2014 report by the city\xe2\x80\x99s Independent Budget Office. Many of the new principals from that era had little or no teaching experience and were trained in how to undermine the teachers union\xe2\x80\x99s school-level leaders and target those teachers who they felt were not on their \xe2\x80\x9cteam,\xe2\x80\x9d even if they were highly experienced. The situation worsened when former Schools Chancellor Joel Klein created a school funding formula that incentivized getting rid of more costly veteran teachers in favor of less expensive new teachers.\nThe drive to eliminate tenure can be understood as a part of a larger effort by a coterie of billionaire education \xe2\x80\x9creformers,\xe2\x80\x9d such as Bloomberg, Bill Gates and the Walton Family, who seek to deprofessionalize teaching and make it a low-skill, low-wage position in which an interchangeable workforce with no job security administers scripted curricula and oversees standardized test preparation. We are already far down this road and unfortunately the two major national teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, have collaborated more with the so-called reformers than they have opposed them.\nIt remains to be seen whether an anti-teacher tenure lawsuit can succeed in New York, which has more rigorous tenure laws than California \xe2\x80\x94 a three-year probationary period and an allowance for principals to extend probation year after year. The teachers union here in New York is hungry for a seat at the table with the Democratic Party. It also has little stomach to put up a real fight to hold principals and the higher-ups who install them accountable or to engage in a struggle to channel equitable resources to troubled schools, so the future of teacher tenure is uncertain.\xc2\xa0\nNorm Scott is a former New York City schoolteacher.

It\xe2\x80\x99s completely government-run: no insurance companies or profit motives, just federal employees paid to give veterans the best care possible.\nIn light of the problems, were universal health care advocates wrong to tout the VA?\nThe short answer: no. The long waits and understaffing are real \xe2\x80\x94 but the VA\xe2\x80\x99s quality of care, measured in outcomes and patient satisfaction, consistently rates better than the private system.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, said VA workers we talked to, but it does better for veterans and their challenging health needs than the private system ever could.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love the VA and would never work in the private system again,\xe2\x80\x9d said one provider. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to spend an hour or two a day on the phone with private insurance companies or writing letters to them. \xe2\x80\xa6 [At the VA] it\xe2\x80\x99s not about making a buck.\xe2\x80\x9d (The agency tries to rein in press contact, so some providers asked us not to use their names.)\nThe real solutions to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s problems may sound familiar. The VA needs to hire more frontline staff and fewer managers. It needs to update an antiquated computerized scheduling system, expand facilities where need is growing and reduce missed appointments by offering rides.\nIt needs to use data such as wait time statistics as tools for improvement, not bludgeons. And it needs to act on feedback from concerned workers, instead of squelching it.\nThe Veterans Health Administration runs hospitals and clinics to care for veterans who got injured while serving. (It\xe2\x80\x99s separate from the Military Health System, which covers current service members.)\nLow-income veterans and those rated 50 percent or more disabled by a service-connected injury can get comprehensive care and medications through the VA free of charge. For those with lesser disabilities, care for the service-connected disability is still free, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a co-pay for unrelated care.\nFor some, the VA is their only option. For others, it\xe2\x80\x99s their best option. A neurology provider estimated 50 percent of her patients have private insurance or Medicare, so they could seek care elsewhere, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they choose to come see me, because the care is better.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThanks to new military and medical technologies, soldiers in the recent wars are surviving traumas that a generation ago would have killed them. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s much better shielding, thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Irma Westmoreland, a registered nurse and the Veterans Affairs chair of National Nurses United (NNU), \xe2\x80\x9cbut now they come back with brain injuries, amputations, multi-system injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo health care workers at the VA develop special expertise, including in the kinds of psychological traumas veterans suffer. Specialists outside the agency \xe2\x80\x9clook to us on how to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Westmoreland.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re closing mental health facilities and wards everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does Congress really think privatizing access to this care is going to help? It\xe2\x80\x99s not. They have less beds than we do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nScheduling Headaches\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s causing the long waits and \xe2\x80\x9csecret wait lists\xe2\x80\x9d that are making headlines? The VA sent auditors around to investigate.\nIn Portland, Oregon, most employees interviewed opted to have a representative of the Government Employees (AFGE) union present, said Local 2157 President Amanda Schroeder. AFGE has 210,000 members at the VA.\nThe union rep was there not only to protect the member against coercion and retaliation, but also to compile the local\xe2\x80\x99s own recommendations \xe2\x80\x94 from the perspective of workers and patients, rather than agency bean-counters.\nTwo big themes came through, Schroeder said: the VA\xe2\x80\x99s outdated scheduling system, and the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwoefully understaffed.\xe2\x80\x9d\nClerks enter appointments into a cumbersome computer system that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe even pre-DOS,\xe2\x80\x9d one worker said. It won\xe2\x80\x99t accept appointments beyond 90 days into the future. Clerks have to enter those into a second system, slowing everything down.\nIt also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that scheduling is dictated rather than negotiated: you get a letter telling you the date and time of your appointment. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t make it, you can try calling to reschedule, but the phone lines are often busy.\nThis means more missed appointments. The neurology provider estimated that 30-50 percent of her appointments are no-shows. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s dismal,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOther veterans could have been seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother reason for no-shows is the cost and difficulty of getting to the nearest VA clinic, especially for disabled patients. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the no-show rate is worst at the end of the month, when patients\xe2\x80\x99 wallets are thinnest.\nA van service run by the nonprofit Disabled American Veterans helps, but you still have to get yourself to the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s meetup point, and the round trip can take all day. Better would be for the VA to provide rides to patients, as it used to.\nPerhaps the biggest cause of the wait-list problem is that there simply aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough medical staff.\nEveryone\xe2\x80\x99s stretched thin. Schroeder said physicians\xe2\x80\x99 patient lists, which should be no more than 1,200 patients, can reach 1,700.\nIn the Augusta, Georgia, hospital where Westmoreland works, nurses in most areas are responsible for eight to 15 patients, and sometimes as many as 20. Surgeries are commonly canceled, she said, because there aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough beds or nurses available.\nAs in the private sector, the agency isn\xe2\x80\x99t obliged to bargain over staffing. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no federal limit on nurse-to-patient ratios, although NNU is calling for one.\nWhen nurses do file objections to unsafe staffing, Westmoreland said, they can be blamed and targeted. AFGE members too have suffered reprisals for whistleblowing. Some were even told not to talk to their congressional reps, Schroeder said.\nThe federal agency charged with defending whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel, announced June 5 it\xe2\x80\x99s investigating 37 cases of alleged retaliation against employees who spoke up about scheduling or patient care.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a huge element of fear,\xe2\x80\x9d Schroeder said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the union, I think nobody would ever come forward with anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x98Half a Toolbox, 10 Nails\xe2\x80\x99\nVA workers have been facing new pressure to meet federally determined performance metrics. The old standard was that vets should wait no more than 30 days for an appointment.\nWord came down in 2011 of the new standard: 14 days. VA executives\xe2\x80\x99 bonuses depended on hitting targets, which meant more grief for frontline staff. (Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki suspended the bonuses before resigning.)\nOf course, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s in favor of shorter waits. But changing the target doesn\xe2\x80\x99t magically solve short staffing or scheduling snafus. Health care workers at the VA found themselves in the same boat as teachers who are told to boost their students\xe2\x80\x99 test scores this year \xe2\x80\x94 but with the same class sizes, student problems and administrative burdens they had to work with last year.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe just have been essentially told to build a house, and given half a toolbox and 10 nails,\xe2\x80\x9d Schroeder said.\nLike many VA employees, she\xe2\x80\x99s a disabled veteran herself, and passionate about the agency\xe2\x80\x99s mission. All the workers we spoke to wanted to improve a system they believe in, not scrap it.\nThe House and Senate passed separate bills in June to contract out more care. During a two-year trial period, both bills would require the agency to pay private providers to care for veterans who face long waits or 40-mile drives to the nearest VA facility. A reconciled bill is expected.\nAFGE endorsed the Senate version, co-sponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders and John McCain, which also includes provisions to boost VA hiring and expand clinic space.\nPutting a sunny face on it, the union commended Sanders for making sure the trial period tracks \xe2\x80\x9cthe quality, cost, and timeliness of care secured from the private sector.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStill, the plan could be the thin end of the wedge of privatization, pushing veterans out to navigate a fragmented private system on their own.\nThe VA\xe2\x80\x99s national coordination is one of its strengths: a centralized medical record, for instance, so all your providers can see the same test results. You never have to repeat an X-ray because you can\xe2\x80\x99t get the last one sent over.\nDespite the short staffing, \xe2\x80\x9cI work with better clinicians at the VA than anywhere else I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked,\xe2\x80\x9d said a specialty provider who\xe2\x80\x99d worked in private practice and for nonprofits.\nWhile private surgeons get paid per surgery, the neurology provider said, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell patients all the time, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sending you to our VA neurosurgeon. They will only operate on you if you need it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x98Meatgrinder Wars\xe2\x80\x99\nOne more way we could help alleviate the strain on the VA, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow about not sending people into these meatgrinder war zones?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to redeploy someone who\xe2\x80\x99s already rated 70 percent disabled for post-traumatic stress disorder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schroeder, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we see it all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe neurology provider said many of her patients, men in their twenties, are so traumatized from multiple deployments and blasts that they can hardly function.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered the kind of trauma they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, all their health problems are worse,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, they\xe2\x80\x99re depressed, they\xe2\x80\x99re anxious \xe2\x80\x94 and that makes everything else worse.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often say if somebody could sit in my chair for a couple weeks, they would have a completely different perspective on war and what we do when we send people in.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis article appeared in Labor Notes #424, July 2014.\n'",b'\n',"b'August 13, 2014'","b'Sitting on the stoop of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s 3-bedroom garden apartment in Queens, I watch over my 4-year-old son playing in the courtyard. It\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar, comforting spot. Many members of my partner and I\xe2\x80\x99s extended family live here, in the same small, tight-knit community that I grew up in. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m raising my family here too.\nThis intergenerational community would never have been possible if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to affordable housing. For us, it takes the form of rent-stabilized apartments. But many other New Yorkers are not, or are no longer, so lucky.\nThere are only about 1 million units of rent-stabilized housing left in New York City, a 20 percent decrease since 1981. Rent stabilization, a law that provides for annual caps on the rent hikes landlords can impose, is one of the best regulations we have for maintaining true affordability. So it is no surprise that as rent-stabilized units are vacated, landlords swoop in to move them into deregulated, market-rate status. The law itself has been under attack for decades and continues to be eroded by lawmakers and developers looking to reap high profits in \xe2\x80\x9cdesirable\xe2\x80\x9d neighborhoods.\nLow- and middle-income families across the entire city are facing major difficulties in finding homes they can afford and staying in them. Over the last decade, the increase in rent costs has been double that of wages. Simultaneously, even with decent inclusionary zoning practices \xe2\x80\x94 rules that mandate that any new development or rehab include a percentage of affordable units \xe2\x80\x94 these families are being closed out of the vast majority of new housing being built in the five boroughs. \xe2\x80\x9cAffordability\xe2\x80\x9d is defined using a calculation of Area Median Income (AMI), and that takes huge swaths of a region into account \xe2\x80\x94 lumping millionaires, middle-class families and the working poor together. In a city with one of the highest wealth disparities in the nation, \xe2\x80\x9caffordable\xe2\x80\x9d homes are effectively out of reach for low-income and extremely low-income New Yorkers.\nIn addition, even those who can \xe2\x80\x9cafford\xe2\x80\x9d to remain \xe2\x80\x94 often, by just scraping by \xe2\x80\x94 have to prepare for living in a drastically overhauled neighborhood. Such a neighborhood is one in which affordable food, schools, health care and other services are no longer available because the local economy has shifted to meet the desires and needs of a new, wealthier demographic. This is the full picture of gentrification.\nNot Just NYC\nThe situation is not unique to New York. We are in the midst of a national housing affordability crisis the likes of which this country has never known. According to the Center for American Progress\xe2\x80\x99 2012 report, The Housing Market is Not Only for Homeowners, nationally, rents climbed 4 percent in 2012 alone and another 4.6 percent in 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 and are expected to increase by at least 4 percent per year in 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, real median renter incomes fell over much of the beginning of the century, ending 13 percent lower in 2012 than in 2000. Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Joint Center for Housing Studies\xe2\x80\x99 2013 report, America\xe2\x80\x99s Rental Housing: Evolving Markets and Needs, revealed that almost half of renters, 46 percent, earn below $30,000 annually, including 22 percent whose income is below $15,000 \xe2\x80\x94 roughly equivalent to working year-round at the minimum wage.\nThe foreclosure crisis has driven millions of former homeowners into the rental market. And recent reports of a housing market rebound are misleading: Nationally, economic and social costs for most renter households are increasing and are expected to worsen in coming years. For low-income renters in particular, chronic housing insecurity has reached disastrous proportions, exacerbated by weak federal, state and local protections for renters, immense tax breaks for developers that undercut revenue generation for cities and states and the entrance of the corporate landlord.\nThe most recent growth of, corporate landlord holdings has been driven by private equity firms, and chances are that they\xe2\x80\x99re run by the same actors who crashed the economy the last time around. These firms are buying up single-family foreclosures and non-performing loans across the country, properties that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) are eager to get off their hands. They are then converting them to rental properties and charging rents that often times exceed even local market rates.\nTaking advantage of weak renter protections, these firms are gobbling up housing stock \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ve gained hundreds of thousands of units over the last 2 years \xe2\x80\x94 and offering rentals that are poorly rehabbed, suffer from pest problems and are inaccessible to those formerly incarcerated or low-income families. In the meantime, they wait for the values of these homes to rise, so they can evict their tenants and move the properties back into the market for purchase. It is presumed that these \xe2\x80\x9cbad actors\xe2\x80\x9d are hoping that their business will continue to grow rapidly and without much public scrutiny.\nRenter Resistance\nThe growing threat to accessible stable housing will only be curbed by robust renter organizing around the country, and tenants and local housing groups are stepping up and calling attention to the issues on the ground. In New York City, groups like the Brooklyn-based Crown Heights Tenants Union and the newer Queens-based Ridgewood Tenants Union are organizing tenants to join with other decades-old community groups in a fight to ensure that Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s plans for housing create quality and affordability for the city\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable communities.\nIn Boston, foreclosure, tenant and environmental groups like City Life/Vida Urbana (CLVU), Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) and Alternatives for Community and Environment (ACE) have joined forces to combat developers who are driving rent and home prices through the roof. In Los Angeles, longtime housing groups and community developers like Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE) and East Los Angeles Community Corporation are engaging congressional representatives to take on corporate landlords and keep community wealth where it belongs. And in Rhode Island, a local coalition of tenants and homeowners led by Direct Action for Rights and Equality (DARE) have just won a statewide ordinance around just-cause evictions.\nIn terms of policy, ensuring decent housing as a right rather than as a commodity represents the best path forward for long-term community stability and broad-based prosperity. All levels of government must recognize and protect this right and, concretely, prioritize the provision of decent housing for those most in need.\nHow can we achieve this? Tenants, organizers and lawmakers must assert the concept of housing security more regularly. Housing security is not simply a reflection of affordability, which is generally the primary consideration that drives current debates. Instead, it recognizes that decent housing involves paying attention to a number of interrelated concerns. In brief, these are affordability; accessibility; long-term stability and protection from displacement; health, sustainability and quality; and community control.\nTaken together, these five pillars comprise a model that meaningfully engages with the interests of those for whom housing insecurity has been, or may become, a fact of life. If we uphold these principles as tenants, organizers and lawmakers, then we have the chance to foster healthy communities in permanently affordable housing and break the unacceptable pattern of failure that has defined this country\xe2\x80\x99s investment (or lack thereof) in housing for decades. Nothing can replace traditional community organizing as the vehicle to achieve this, and now, more than ever, is the time to invest in organizing that works to reclaim, remain in and rebuild our communities.\nRachel LaForest is the executive director of the Right to the City Alliance.

They were gathered around a tree on a Utah ranch earlier this summer.\nThe speaker, Mary Kathryn Nagle, a playwright and citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, tied the ribbon around her wrist. \xe2\x80\x9cI am with you,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nagle to the colleague concerned with the vulnerability of Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s coastline. Another participant stepped up.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe future of my children\xe2\x80\x99s children,\xe2\x80\x9d he read aloud, and tied that ribbon to his wrist.\n\xe2\x80\x9cClean air and water,\xe2\x80\x9d read another.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe park I play soccer in,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are with you!\xe2\x80\x9d said everyone.\nAnd so it went.\nThis ribbon exchange was an attempt to name and witness what each person loved in the world that climate chaos could take away, or is already taking away. By tying each other\xe2\x80\x99s ribbons around their wrists, the participants made a proverbial treaty, vowing to support each other to beat back climate chaos, so that their hopes, not their fears, would be fulfilled. It was the start of what would become the Climate Ribbon project.\xc2\xa0\nThe Climate Ribbon\nThe Climate Ribbon aspires to be \xe2\x80\x9can AIDS Quilt for the climate justice movement,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrew Boyd, a longtime artist-activist and one of the project\xe2\x80\x99s organizers. He\xe2\x80\x99s on the edge of his seat, a couch at Mayday Space, the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March\xe2\x80\x99s artist convergence space in Bushwick.\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a question, why up till now has there been so little public action on climate change?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Gan Golan, one of the project\xe2\x80\x99s co-founders and a lead organizer of the arts hub at Mayday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt turns out, it may not be from a lack of awareness, but in some ways, because of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrief. Loss. Fear,\xe2\x80\x9d chimes in Boyd. \xe2\x80\x9cMassive species die-off. Neighborhoods washed away. Our children\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x99s future at grave risk. Harvests ruined. Livelihoods destroyed. These are some of the things we stand to lose \xe2\x80\x94 and in many places are already losing \xe2\x80\x94 to climate chaos. It can be overwhelming.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we try to absorb the full consequences of what is now happening \xe2\x80\x94 and the enormity of what is yet to come \xe2\x80\x94 we can easily become paralyzed. When we experience these feelings alone, the issue feels too big, the costs too difficult to grapple with,\xe2\x80\x9d adds Golan. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of being spurred to action, we often turn away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d says Boyd, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we create a safe container to go through these feelings collectively, together with others, something different happens. Instead of holding the feelings in, we let them out. Instead of isolation, we can find solidarity. Instead of powerlessness, we find empowerment. Instead of resignation, we pave a way toward action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, it\xe2\x80\x99s about moving us from the me to the we. Sometimes art and ritual can do that in ways that conventional organizing and protest don\xe2\x80\x99t do as powerfully,\xe2\x80\x9d says Golan.\xc2\xa0\nFrom this central insight the Climate Ribbon was born.\nRising from 11th\xc2\xa0Avenue\nOn September 21, a massive tree will rise up from the middle of Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s industrial 11th Avenue, its branches entwined with hand-dyed fabric stretching out above the streets. Imagine thousands of people gathering around the tree\xe2\x80\x99s colossal roots as they come to the end of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March. They each unwrap a handwritten ribbon they\xe2\x80\x99ve carried with them across Manhattan and tie it to radial lines emanating from the sculpture, forming long multicolored roots that stretch out in every direction.\nAs the theme of the march tells us: It takes roots to weather the storm.\nOne by one, marchers tie their ribbons to the tree, then search through the thousands of others, each inscribed with a message, and the ritual of loss and recommitment begins.\nThis massive \xe2\x80\x9ctree of life\xe2\x80\x9d is being built by Brooklyn-based artist Swoon and her cadre of artist-engineers. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same tree \xe2\x80\x94 just re-worked for the outdoors and public ritual \xe2\x80\x94 that stood at the center of Swoon\xe2\x80\x99s celebrated show at the Brooklyn Museum, \xe2\x80\x9cSubmerged Motherlands,\xe2\x80\x9d which flooded the museum with beautiful wreckage, lifelike forms and painted characters inspired by the artist\xe2\x80\x99s own experience of Hurricane Sandy and beyond.\nThe tied-on ribbons will become the tree\xe2\x80\x99s roots and leaves, an apt symbol of how we are bound up with the Earth; how we are both the root cause of climate chaos and together have the power to change it; how we are the ancestors and the future generations; and how, as Martin Luther King, Jr. said so eloquently, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all tied together in a single garment of destiny.\xe2\x80\x9d Together, these collective commitments will weave a giant tapestry among all of us for a healthy and sustainable planet.\nAccording to Betsy Richards, an advisor to the project since its birth-moment and a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, the ribbons will \xe2\x80\x9ccompose a kind of \xe2\x80\x98people\xe2\x80\x99s treaty,\xe2\x80\x99 inspired in part by Northeastern Native American quahog and whelk shell wampum belts that signify the mutual exchange of trust that takes place when commitments are made between peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nThis treaty-making doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end on 11th Avenue. Golan and Boyd hope to inspire activists in Lima and Paris, the sites of the next major U.N. summits on climate change, to organize Climate Ribbon and Tree of Life projects in their cities. They\xe2\x80\x99re also assembling an instruction kit so the ritual could easily become a neighborhood activity around a living tree or an exercise taken up by religious congregations, union halls, classrooms and beyond. One of the early enthusiasts, the Reverend Juan Carlos Ruiz, a \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity catalyst\xe2\x80\x9d at St. Jacobi Church in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, believes that rituals like the Climate Ribbon \xe2\x80\x9chave a power, beyond words, to connect us through our grieving into new ways of being and relating to one another and the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nRae Abileah is a social change strategist and a co-organizer of the Climate Ribbon project.

These scenes made my heart race in an all-too-familiar way. I was devastated for Michael Brown, his family and the people of Ferguson. Almost immediately, I closed my eyes and felt the fear I have for my own family.\nIn the wake of the climate disaster that was Hurricane Katrina almost 10 years ago, I saw the same images of police, pointing military weapons at unarmed black people with their hands in the air. In the name of \xe2\x80\x9crestoring order,\xe2\x80\x9d my family and their community were demonized as \xe2\x80\x9clooters\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d When crisis hits, the underlying racism in our society comes to the surface in very clear ways.\nI was outraged by Mike Brown\xe2\x80\x99s murder, and at the same time wondered why people were so surprised; this is sadly a common experience of black life in America. In 2012, an unarmed black man was killed by authorities at the rate of every 28 hours, and it has increased since then.\nClimate change is bringing nothing if not clarity to the persistent and overlapping crises of our time. The connection between it, militarized state violence and racism is commonsense and intuitive. I grew up black in America, specifically in New Mexico, a place ravaged by climate impacts. New Mexico is, as Oscar Olivera noted, showing the early signs of what sparked the Cochabamba Water Wars in Bolivia, which were yet another example of how oppression and extreme weather combine to \xe2\x80\x9cincite\xe2\x80\x9d militarized violence.\nThe problems of Cochabamba and Katrina are not just about the hurricane or the drought \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re about what happened after. It is the institutional neglect of vulnerable communities in crisis, the criminalization of our people met with state violence, the ongoing displacement of New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99 black residents through the demolition of affordable housing to make room for high-rise condos. It all adds up to corporations exploiting our tragedy using the tools of racism, division and dehumanization \xe2\x80\x94 what Naomi Klein calls the shock doctrine. And the problems are also about what happened before: how black and brown communities had fossil fuel extraction imposed on them in the first place, in the form of gas wells and coal and tar sands refineries in their backyards.\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, black and brown people were seen as \xe2\x80\x9cdisposable,\xe2\x80\x9d and the powers-that-be painted the victims and heroes as villains. After Mike Brown\xe2\x80\x99s killing, we saw much of the same. The hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown trended on Twitter in reaction to the media\xe2\x80\x99s prejudiced portrayal of Mike Brown and countless other victims like him. Black folks asked: if I were killed by police, how would I be portrayed? It illustrated how central a racist and victim-blaming cultural narrative is to media response in such situations.\nIf extreme weather is about droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, the way people get treated in the wake of disaster is about power. A discourse that dehumanizes and blames the victims makes black and brown communities even more vulnerable than they already are in the wake of climate disasters. If we hope to build anything together, we must deny that anyone is an \xe2\x80\x9cother.\xe2\x80\x9d Dismantling this pervasive cultural norm isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a crucial challenge we must overcome.\nEnvironmental Racism\nCommunities of color and poor communities are hit hardest by fossil fuel extraction, as well as neglected by the state in the wake of crisis. People of color also disproportionately live in climate-vulnerable areas. Similarly, state violence should concern us all, but the experience of young black men in particular in this country is unique. Those of us who are not young black men must step up to the challenge of understanding that we will likely never experience that level of demonization. That kind of solidarity is what it takes to build real people power \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of power that stands up unflinchingly to injustice, and helps us all win our battles by standing together.\nThis is difficult work. Some of it requires listening and working with racial justice organizations, and some of it requires introspection, questioning what we have been taught and healing from internal oppression. Part of that work involves climate organizers acknowledging and understanding that our fight is not simply with the carbon in the sky, but with the powers on the ground.\nMany people have pointed out that the climate movement needs to understand our internal disparity of power too: between mainstream and grassroots organizations, between people of color and white folks, between the global north and the global south. We need to account for these things if we truly want to build the diverse movement leadership that we will need to win.\nThe events in Ferguson offer an important lesson if you\xe2\x80\x99re a climate organizer, looking around the room, wondering where the \xe2\x80\x9cpeople of color\xe2\x80\x9d are. It\xe2\x80\x99s a time to dig deep and ask yourself if you really care about why they aren\xe2\x80\x99t there \xe2\x80\x94 and if you are committed to the deep work, solidarity and learning that it will take to bring more \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d to our movement. Personally, I think the climate movement is up to this necessary challenge.\nClimate Change and State Repression\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t stress enough how important it is for me, as a black climate justice advocate, as well as for my people, to see the climate movement show solidarity with the people of Ferguson and with black communities around the country striving for justice. Other movements have stepped up to the plate: labor, LGBTQ and immigrant rights groups have all taken the firm stand that they have the backs of the black community. Solidarity and allyship is important in and of itself. The fossil fuel industry would love to see us siloed into believing that we can each win by ourselves on \xe2\x80\x9csingle issues.\xe2\x80\x9d Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the climate movement to show up \xe2\x80\x94 and show that we will not stand for the \xe2\x80\x9cothering\xe2\x80\x9d of the black community in America, or anyone else.\nIf we knew everything we needed to know about navigating the climate and ecological crises, we would have done it already. But as crisis escalates, as climate change gets worse, we had better get ready to see a whole lot more state violence and repression, unless we organize to change it. Now is the time to stand with and listen to the wisdom of our allies in other movements.\nI could tell you all day about the brilliant and strategic analysis and leaders that exist in historically oppressed communities. I could tell you. But your path to understanding why solidarity is important is your own. Don\xe2\x80\x99t miss this opportunity to dig in and show up. If we mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, it will be because we understood our enemies and leveraged our collective power to take them down and let our vision spring up. Take a moment today to read the demands of the Dream Defenders, Freedomside and Organizing Black Struggle. Read about solidarity and white allyship, and identify anti-blackness showing up in your spaces. Take a moment today to really think about how we should confront the climate crisis and ask yourself if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to dive in for the long haul.\nThe more complex \xe2\x80\x94 and less comfortable \xe2\x80\x94 we allow ourselves to be, the more simple things actually become: We are in this together and our fights are connected. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know everything by ourselves, but together we know enough.\nDeirdre Smith is strategic partnership coordinator at 350.org, which published an earlier version of this piece.\nThe Indypendent\xc2\xa0is a New York City-based newspaper that publishes 13 times a year.

Big NGOs and unions have played an important role in preparations for the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March as well. However, this time organizers for the climate march are relying much more on a decentralized \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork\xe2\x80\x9d approach to mobilizing people that draws on the experience of the Occupy movement.\nThe centerpiece of this effort is the climate march\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 100 autonomous working groups (or \xe2\x80\x9chubs,\xe2\x80\x9d as they are called) that are self-organizing around visions of climate justice that reflect the priorities of their members.\nThe various hubs encompass a wide array of constituencies. Some hubs, like \xe2\x80\x9cCommunications\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cVideographers,\xe2\x80\x9d will serve a particular function at the march. Others focus on environmental issues such as fracking and nuclear power, and still others on possible solutions \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cClean and Green Business,\xe2\x80\x9d for example. The largest number of hubs are based on local, regional or state geography (including one hub for each of the five boroughs) or identity: women, elders, immigrants, vegans, youth, scientists and LGBTQ and indigenous people, among others.\nSome of the hubs, such as the labor and faith blocs, have been part of the organizing from very early on, while others received a boost after a large organizing meeting at the New School on July 1. Many of these hubs are currently focusing their efforts on how to build a meaningful and memorable presence at the march itself \xe2\x80\x94 the fracking hub, for instance, has been meeting, hosting conference calls and holding art builds with the intention of conveying fracking\xe2\x80\x99s threat to the climate during the march itself. In doing so, however, alliances are being built and networks are being established for organizing together around longer-term goals.\nBig Tent Organizing\nLike Occupy Wall Street, the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March has refused to issue a unified set of demands. It has, instead, favored \xe2\x80\x9cbig tent\xe2\x80\x9d organizing. And like OWS, which took on the 1 percent\xe2\x80\x99s power over the political process, this march is tackling an issue that many know is a serious problem but that still remains outside mainstream discourse\nGiven this, it makes sense that similar tactics would be adopted in both messaging and structure. Like OWS, the march\xe2\x80\x99s greatest success may ultimately be both its impact on the larger conversation and the continuing activities of its constituent parts \xe2\x80\x94 just as many Occupy-inspired groups did important work after the Zuccotti Park encampment was destroyed by the NYPD.\nHowever, the OWS analogy goes only so far. Unlike Occupy, this march was initiated by large NGOs such as Avaaz and 350.org. There are great disparities in money, influence and media access among the various groups working on the climate march. For this event to be a foundation for a new kind of movement, larger organizations will need to continue providing support to the grassroots groups that are giving so much of their time and energy to ensuring the march\xe2\x80\x99s success.\nThis means supporting the work of environmental justice groups like The Point in the Bronx and UPROSE in Brooklyn and taking local infrastructure campaigns \xe2\x80\x94 such as the fight against Port Ambrose, the proposed liquefied natural gas terminal that could be built off the shore of Long Island\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 seriously. It also requires understanding that the climate movement must support larger struggles for social justice and understanding that the climate crisis is a crisis of capitalism.\nOne of Occupy\xe2\x80\x99s greatest lessons was that organizers should not fear a radical critique. Radicalism facilitates a systemic analysis, and this larger analysis actually widens the constituency you are building as more and more people see their concerns voiced. It appears the climate justice movement is learning this lesson. But as significant as the march is, it\xe2\x80\x99s what we do after it\xe2\x80\x99s over that matters the most.\nPatrick Robbins is a member of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March host committee and an activist with Sane Energy Project.\nTo learn more about the hubs organizing for the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March, see peoplesclimate.org/organizing.\nThe Indypendent\xc2\xa0is a New York City-based newspaper that publishes 13 times a year.

Decentralized organizkng ultjmately failed OWS too.\n'","b'October 28, 2014'","b'When he coughed, I flinched. As the train left Jamaica Station, I studied the people with airport luggage. What if one of them has Ebola? The deadly virus has spread through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and was carried by an infected jet passenger to Dallas, where he died. Then, a doctor was diagnosed with it right here in New York. Had it spread? Was it on this train? Shaking my head, I realized that we\xe2\x80\x99re infected with something worse than Ebola.\nParanoia is the first symptom of a plague. When news of an infectious disease like Ebola, SARS or swine flu breaks, the risks quickly ignite underlying social fears that themselves become a danger. When the disease passes, carrying off however many or few to an early death, what remains is the bigotry. Today it is West African immigrants, yesterday it was gay men during the HIV panic and hundreds of years ago, during the Black Death of the 14th century, it was Jews.\nThroughout history, terrified people have hidden behind barricades and turned on scapegoats. It\xe2\x80\x99s happening again as conservatives sound alarms about Ebola. They want to stop flights from West Africa. And seal the border with Mexico. They demand we become Fortress America. And build walls to quarantine the sick. But it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly those \xe2\x80\x9cwalls,\xe2\x80\x9d whether physical, psychological or both, that cause unnecessary mass death.\nOn the other side, trapped in quarantine, are panicked people trying to escape. If they see no hope, no new doctors or hospitals, they will run. And when they do, it will make contact tracing nearly impossible. They need intervention, not isolation. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that by December, the outbreak could pick up pace to 10,000 new cases a week. By January, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that 1.4 million people will be infected. And if the mortality rate stays at 70 percent, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the death of roughly a million human beings. If they die, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be from Ebola but from the politics of fear.\nOrigins of the Disease\nDecember 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 in the Guinean village of Meliandou, a 2-year-old boy vomits into his hands. He is cradled by his mother, who washes him down as his eyes flutter. Days after he dies, she is coughing up blood and stumbling in a fever haze in the street. Later, her body is handled by family and friends, who prepare it for a funeral. Mourners come to pay their respects, and many unwittingly carry the Ebola virus away with them.\nA team of researchers, led by Fabian Leendertz of the Robert Koch Institute of Berlin, mapped the current outbreak to a bat colony near the village. They think that the young boy was bitten by one and became infected.\nDiscovered in 1976, Ebola first broke out in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formally known as Zaire). Each epidemic begins with fruit bats, which are immune to the virus but act as its natural reservoir. Ebola spreads from them after they drop partly-eaten fruit that is then polished off by grazing animals like gorillas, that in turn are hunted and eaten by humans. Or directly, when the bats are caught and eaten by people.\nSince 1976 at least fifteen Ebola outbreaks have been recorded. Three of these were major ones. In 1995, the virus killed 254 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Five years later another outbreak in Uganda took 224. Since then there have been only sporadic and smaller incidents, until now. As of this writing, the WHO reports nearly 10,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths. But the WHO and other governmental institutions openly acknowledge this is an underestimation. The real number many be many times more and the transmission rate is growing exponentially.\nAs deadly as it is, one reason Ebola has not become an epidemic until now is because it is actually hard to catch. Direct contact with an infected person\xe2\x80\x99s bodily fluids \xe2\x80\x94 blood, feces, vomit, semen, mucus, sweat, tears, breast milk or urine \xe2\x80\x94 is the method of transmission. If the virus gets into orifices like the nose, mouth, eyes, vagina or anus, or in open wounds, then you get infected.\nThe first symptoms are fatigue, fever and aching joints. They appear between two to 21 days after exposure, and after that it becomes possible to infect others. An infected individual will then feel chest pain and shortness of breath and may get a skin rash. Ebola drills microscopic holes in the capillaries, causing the body to bleed internally. They may cough up blood. The whites of the eyes may go red.\nThe mortality rate of Ebola can be anywhere from 25 to 90 percent, depending on how developed the health care infrastructure in the location of the outbreak is. Treatment is only symptomatic. Doctors can\xe2\x80\x99t cure the virus but only stabilize the body with hydrotherapy and plasma and blood transfusions. All of this means that the final tally of who lives and who dies is not about the disease itself but the political and economic history surrounding it. We are not dealing with an End Times plague but with the lottery of death.\nThe Petri Dish of Disaster\n\xe2\x80\x9cEBOLA IS REAL,\xe2\x80\x9d read the sign. On the rain-swept streets of Monrovia, Liberia, people see bright street murals warning of the virus and detailing its symptoms. When Vice News reporter Danny Gold went to visit the city\xe2\x80\x99s Redemption Hospital, his cameraman recorded corpses covered with cardboard in the street. At the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s entrance, an Ebola-stricken man lay in the latrine.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is completely overwhelmed,\xe2\x80\x9d Gold said as looked at the camera, eyes knotted with frustration. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is just a complete shortage of medical professionals, health care facilities, of space to treat this disease.\xe2\x80\x9d Behind his simple statement is an unspoken history, which is that Western imperialism has made Africa into a petri dish of disaster.\nThe first social condition of this outbreak is the centuries of imperialism, neocolonialism, civil war and local corruption that left West African infrastructure in tatters. The D.C.-based think tank Fund for Peace, which assesses the security environment of developing countries, put Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone near the bottom of its Fragile States index. These nations have weak central governments, porous borders, sparse public services, high crime and precarious economies. The Ebola pandemic is not a biological disaster, it\xe2\x80\x99s a political one.\nIn the wake of poverty comes food scarcity. If one of the main disease vectors for Ebola is infected bushmeat, monkey and bat specifically, then the repeated danger of outbreak will only be curbed when people have a secure food supply. The Vice News segment Monkey Meat and the Ebola Outbreak in Liberia showed that despite a government ban, a whole warehouse of illegal bushmeat was for sale. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t eat certain kinds of meat,\xe2\x80\x9d Jefferson Coleman, a Liberian, said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are going to put a lot of people out of business.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeforestation is the other element. In the new millennium\xe2\x80\x99s scramble for Africa, huge swaths of forest have been sawed down. Armies of men have cut Guinea\xe2\x80\x99s forest to one-fifth its original size, half of Liberia\xe2\x80\x99s forest has been sold to logging companies and Sierra Leone is at risk of becoming a bald wasteland. As people drive deeper into the woods to mine, log and clear land for crops, human beings become more exposed to bats and monkeys that may have Ebola.\nAnother social condition worsening the epidemic is that people in fragile states are often deeply suspicious of their governments. Years of struggle for power among ethnic groups has left many governments washed in blood, and without a popular mandate, governments are seen as a tool of the few. When they do have legitimacy, hollowed-out infrastructure systems and endemic corruption make it nearly impossible for health agencies to spread news to people quickly and effectively. And even when they can, they must often do it painstakingly via radio, murals or word of mouth, since the literacy rates in the three hardest-hit countries are so low. In Guinea it is 41 percent, Liberia 60 percent and Sierra Leone 35 percent.\nAll of this creates a powder keg of fear and rage. Monrovia\xe2\x80\x99s largest slum, West Point, was put in quarantine when Ebola was detected there. When the nearly 80,000 residents woke up to nests of barbed wire and soldiers, they reacted by rioting in the streets, some shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no Ebola.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFinally, in the Global North the neoliberal push for privatizing social services and the market focus on profitable medicines has stalled the search for an Ebola vaccine. In a vicious cycle, government agencies are defunded and then with a skeletal staff are expected to operate fully. When they can\xe2\x80\x99t, the blame is put on them, not the budget cuts. Dr. Frances Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, recently said, \xe2\x80\x9cFrankly if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDressed like astronauts, doctors and nurses in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are fighting to keep patients from dying. Baking inside their protective gear, they see new waves of sick and panicked people arriving at their doorsteps every day. In the slums, more and more of the dead are found in the streets. And none of this, none of this had to happen.\nThe Two Faces of Paranoia\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t come close to me anymore. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to shake my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jonathan King, a Liberian in Staten Island, during an NBC interview. Ebola has already hit New York. Not only one case of the virus, but the fear of it.\nNearly every single day the New York Post and Daily News are screaming about Ebola. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not a front page headline exclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cEbola Here!\xe2\x80\x9d in reference to infected New York doctor Craig Spencer, it\xe2\x80\x99s about low-paying screener jobs at the airport. The paper joins the rising chorus of right-wing hysteria about the disease propagated by Fox News, the National Review, Rush Limbaugh and so many others. Racial paranoia, sometimes disguised, sometimes overt, runs through their commentary. The common theme is that the first Black president is exposing America to the diseased Global South in revenge for white supremacy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cObama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want America to believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re exceptional. He wants us to be just like everybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative icon who campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment, in an interview with the right-wing World Net Daily. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Africa is suffering from Ebola, we ought to join the group and be suffering from it, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s his attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe fantasy of Black revenge pulses from the far right to the center-right. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News pundit, said on ABC\xe2\x80\x99s This Week with George Stephanopoulos that Obama hasn\xe2\x80\x99t banned flights from West Africa due to his \xe2\x80\x9cfamilial connection with Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d The Ebola crisis is the site where fears of a rising tide of people of color, engulfing the City on a Hill, is rendered legible and concealed at the same time. The implicit conflict is between the wretched of the Earth and the pristine whites whose skin is the illuminating beacon of civilization.\nAt the most obscene end, racial paranoia becomes genocidal. \xe2\x80\x9cI rather admire the efficiency of Ebola. From a Malthusian and marketing perspective it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond reproach,\xe2\x80\x9d said British television personality and weekly Sun columnist Katie Hopkins. Her racial cleansing rhetoric was echoed by Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France\xe2\x80\x99s far-right party Front National, who advocated Ebola as way to deal with the \xe2\x80\x9cpopulation explosion\xe2\x80\x9d and France\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Mischievously, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Ebola could sort that out in three months.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPlague paranoia runs both ways, going from the privileged to the oppressed and back again. In a bottom-up fantasy of omnipotent evil, one that mirrors the racial paranoia of the right wing, Minister Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam, wrote in the Final Call that Ebola was designed to kill Black people.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the method that they [the U.S. government] are going to use to depopulate [the world]?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. Among the tactics he suggests are under consideration is \xe2\x80\x9cdisease infection through bio-weapons such as Ebola and AIDS, which are race targeting weapons.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to say that it would exterminate Black people but leave whites untouched. Following him, singer and domestic abuse expert, Chris Brown tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\xa6 But I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control. S\xe2\x80\x93t is getting crazy bruh.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a YouGov poll, 59 percent of African-Americans think more would have been done to fight Ebola if had begun in Europe. Some Black people see it as a terrifying agent of destruction that continues older biological attacks like the Tuskegee Experiment. In it, rural Blacks were given syphilis by the U.S. Department of Health, and then left untreated.\nEbola, deadly as it is, becomes deadlier when viewed through the lens of racial warfare that these two opposing ideologies share. The implications were clearly demonstrated in Nzerekore, a small village in Guinea, when eight aid workers arrived to raise awareness about Ebola. The villagers, scared that the aid workers were bringing the disease, hacked them down with machetes. Their mutilated bodies were found in the latrine days later.\nAmerican Cinema and the Plague\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Ebola Zombie Captured,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Big American News headline. On the web page, a half-rotted Black man with tangled dreads stared out in hopeless, half-dead agony. It was official. The zombie apocalypse was here.\nOf course it was a hoax. The image was doctored. It was a mash-up between a zombie from the film World War Z and a zombie mask sculpture. But not long ago an October 2 ABC report showed a man, thought dead on the streets of Monrovia, be wrapped up by a full-suited burial crew and then begin, limply, to move back to life.\nWhy is fear so contagious? Ebola will ultimately be contained or tragically burn itself out among the poor. It is not a species threat. And yet the waves of terror sweeping across the world have already moved us rightward, reinforcing a conservative vision across the divide between the Third and First Worlds.\nOne answer is that we are living in an era of austerity whose drama of scarcity is translated in art through zombie and apocalyptic narratives. The transformation of the living to the rotting, smelly and hungry undead is a representation of the social trauma of people losing their class status and plummeting into poverty. Until the taboo of openly questioning capitalism is finally and fully purged, these cinematic fantasies will bandage that trauma with supernatural imagery.\nThe zombie apocalypse narrative is currently the dominant fantasy narrative, so when Ebola broke out, it was as if that imaginary world broke into our real one. In a suspension of disbelief, the pandemic we long imagined appeared in news headlines. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if we were suddenly thrown into the series The Walking Dead or Contagion.\nThe emotional engine of the zombie End Times plot is that we must kill those we love because they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed into the undead. The lesson is that to survive in the new dystopia, we must be cold and cruel enough to kill. After the lights of the film or computer screen fade and we walk outside, the narrative of survival scarcity may become our political response to a world filled with the poor and desperate, until we get infected too.\nThe Future of Global Health\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife is rough, and then you die,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Soka Moses said at the JFK Ebola Treatment Center in Liberia during a CNN interview. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, who will do it for us? We have to take the risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the report, a nurse allowed the news crew to fix a camera on his head. Inside the treatment center, a half-conscious man turned on his stretcher, arm flopping out as the nurse injected him with blood. In the hallways, people lay on mats, hovering between life and death. The staff fights to keep them alive, but no matter how much they do, the corpses pile up.\nEbola will come and go but our response will linger long after. It will set the precedent for how we will deal with the next pandemic. And there will be a next one. Climate change is throwing the ecosystem into chaos, our use of antibiotics has hit a wall and more people live in cities and the surrounding slums than at any other time in history. We are all interconnected by trade and travel, yet we live with ossified political and economic structures like the nation and the corporation. It is in a crisis moment like this that our humanity is tested. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to turn away. We can do what Moses is doing with his patients \xe2\x80\x94 put our comfort and safety at risk to recreate that same comfort and safety for many others.\nHere, in the Global North, the first step is to turn away from the racialized apocalyptic fantasy and see the humanity of those who are suffering. \xe2\x80\x9cWorking in a high-risk zone is highly dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d Moses said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have so many patients in agony. And you see some patients and they are dying, all you can do is watch them die. You pray for them and hope that something miraculous happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'",b'\n',b'11/04/2014 - 12:36am',b'Knowledge is power\n',"b'October 28, 2014'","b""The People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March made history on September 21 when 400,000 people paraded through the streets of mid-Manhattan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a glimpse of the movement we need,\xe2\x80\x9d Naomi Klein said afterwards. A day later, Flood Wall Street protesters converged at the tip of Manhattan and poured onto Broadway to carry out nonviolent direct actions that tied up the financial district for hours.\nBut now that the largest-ever climate change protest is behind us, what can people do to build a climate justice movement that can bring about far-reaching change over the coming decades? The Indypendent invited a half-dozen grassroots organizers from New York and elsewhere to share their thoughts.\nFight the FrackersBy Kim Fraczek\nWhen we marched on September 21, we made it clear that it was time to put a stop to new fossil fuel projects and begin making a rapid transition to renewable energy sources. However, that was only one day. We have to continue organizing against these projects in a sustained way if we are going to change our energy system.\nHere in the New York City area, the first thing we need to do is get informed about plans to build a massive liquified natural gas (LNG) facility called Port Ambrose several miles offshore from Long Beach, N.Y., and just up the coast from the Rockaways. Liberty Natural Gas \xe2\x80\x94 a secretive corporation of nameless backers based in the Cayman Islands \xe2\x80\x94 claims Port Ambrose would be used to import gas, but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the intent is to export gas to Europe and Asia at enormous profit. Exporting would allow companies to obtain higher prices for gas, which would lead to more fracking in the Northeast.\nLiquified natural gas is a highly volatile substance, making Port Ambrose an obvious terrorist target. To build such a facility near New York City is reckless. Plus, an offshore wind farm has been proposed for the same area \xe2\x80\x94 we know we need to move to renewable energy, and Long Island residents themselves want wind power, but the two projects cannot coexist. So what do we do?\nStep one is to call Governor Cuomo at 518-474-8390 and tell him to veto Port Ambrose. Additionally, come to our monthly NYC Grassroots Alliance meetings that focus on fracking issues at the New York Society for Ethical Culture. We have a real shot at defeating this port if we work together. The environmental impact statement on the project is due out around the winter holidays, and we need all hands on deck to send a clear message that we do not want LNG \xe2\x80\x94 and then we can work together for offshore wind that\xe2\x80\x99s built right. Sign up for the Sane Energy Project newsletter on our website to remain in the loop.\nSecond, get involved with our Food Not Fracking Alliance. There is compelling evidence that fracking poisons our land and groundwater, harming our ability to grow healthy produce, dairy, wine grapes and other agricultural products. By opposing fracking, we\xe2\x80\x99re standing up for New York State\xe2\x80\x99s proud tradition of farms and vineyards.\nNew York\xe2\x80\x99s future should be as the land of organic food and wine, not as an industrial wasteland for Wall Street profits. Let\xe2\x80\x99s work together to build a shopping list on our Food Not Fracking website of farmers, food distributors and shopkeepers working to keep New York State\xe2\x80\x99s farms safe from toxins and promote a sustainable economy based on healthy local food. Sign up for Food Not Fracking\xe2\x80\x99s emails, join our Facebook page or check our website for details on an upcoming release event for a book by Dr. Michelle Bamberger on page or check our website for details on an upcoming release event for a book by Dr. Michelle Bamberger on fracking's impact on our family, pets and food.\nThird, get the big picture on fracking in New York City and State by visiting our online interactive map of fracking infrastructure. There are at least 40 fracking infrastructure projects currently in the works in this state. You Are Here showcases existing and proposed fracking projects and links users with the frontline affected communities that are organizing at a local level. When we learn each other\xe2\x80\x99s stories, we can build networks effectively, which is how we will make the road to a renewable and sustainable New York. Check out the map, tell your friends and reach out to a local community group in your own backyard.\nKim Fraczek is a coordinator at SANE Energy Project.

We\xe2\x80\x99re in the heart of global capital, and the NYPD doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to act like a private army to defend the rights of the 1%.\nYet by nearly all accounts and metrics, Flood Wall Street on September 22 was an overwhelming success. As many as 3,000 protesters outmaneuvered the surprisingly docile NYPD to overtake the southern tip of Broadway at the iconic Wall Street Bull \xe2\x80\x94 creating an eight-hour-long transportation choke point in the Financial District and derailing traffic 14 blocks north to Chambers Street \xe2\x80\x94 presumably making financial \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d on that day exceedingly difficult.\nThe protest held at its core an anti-capitalist critique of the climate crisis and major news outlets from CNN to Democracy Now! ran headlines like \xe2\x80\x9cClimate Change Protests on Wall Street,\xe2\x80\x9d allowing our message to infiltrate the national debate the day before more than 120 world leaders gathered in New York for the U.N. Climate Summit.\nThe day\xe2\x80\x99s actions culminated with about 100 people (and a polar bear) being arrested during a sit-in at Broadway and Wall Street. As the last protester was escorted into a prisoner transport vehicle, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton emerged from a black sedan to stride briskly across the field. At that moment, our victory felt less than complete.\nPerhaps the city had ceded this battle to us having determined how much more they had to lose on the battlefield of public relations. Imagine the alternate headlines: \xe2\x80\x9cDe Blasio Marches for Climate, Then Cracks Heads on Wall Street \xe2\x80\x94 1,000 Arrests.\xe2\x80\x9d This was too great a risk for a mayor elected on a platform of \xe2\x80\x9cprogressive\xe2\x80\x9d reform, especially sandwiched between the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March and the U.N. Summit. Instead the administration took the one-off disruption in stride and claimed credit the following day for prioritizing First Amendment rights over the free flow of traffic.\nRegardless of the true intentions of the mayor and his police commissioner, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for this city\xe2\x80\x99s social justice community to take a fresh look at the landscape. The NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s newfound sensitivity to appearances at high-profile events like Flood Wall Street suggest that we should be prepared to take full advantage of these opportunities in the future. From a strategic perspective, this means calling for bolder, more confrontational actions that are escalating at the scale of our global crisis. It means moving from mic-checks and roundabout marches to lockdowns and blockades. To be clear: it\xe2\x80\x99s time to put this administration to the test.\nAt the same time \xe2\x80\x94 even more importantly \xe2\x80\x94 we must demand that the same rights and privileges be extended to all NYC residents. We must not allow the NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s calculated leniency toward one group of mostly white, middle-class protesters to obscure the fact that low-income black and brown communities face constant violence from the NYPD. De Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s first year in office has been marked by the police murder of Eric Garner, among many other instances of police brutality. In fact, two days before Flood Wall Street took place, pregnant woman Sandra Amezquita was violently slammed to the ground by police in Sunset Park. This highlights the disparity that exists in our city and we must remind the mayor that until police brutality ends for everyone, it has ended for no one.\nAnd still, the overarching questions we need to stay focused on remain with us. How will state repression and police violence escalate amid worsening climate change? How does the militarization of local police foreshadow the excessive use of force during future resource scarcities? Is it possible for a broad-based social movement to stave off climate chaos using only nonviolent direct action and the building of sustainable alternatives?\nA climate justice movement worthy of its name cannot ignore these issues. In fact, they demand for us to be more daring and more resolved in our struggles.\nSandy Nurse and Zak Solomon were two of the organizers of Flood Wall Street. They are small business owners and community project organizers in Brooklyn, NY.\nIndigenous Wisdom Opens New Paths of ResistanceBy Pennie Opal Plant\nIndigenous communities around the world have been devastated by corrupt fossil fuel corporations for many decades and very few non-indigenous people seemed to notice or care. The genocides, the stereotyping and the lack of respect by the mainstream made these important and powerful voices essentially mute \xe2\x80\x94 until now.\nThe voices of indigenous peoples and other heavily affected communities were at the forefront of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take much more than 400,000 people hitting the streets on a single day in one city to change the broken economic and political systems that have created the climate crisis.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s vital that we continue to stay current on climate science research as well as remain aware of the various manifestations of the climate crisis occurring around the world. When we are well informed, people who don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how delicately balanced and interconnected our planet\xe2\x80\x99s climate systems are are more likely to listen to our concerns.\nWe can also take action where we are. In 2012, indigenous women leaders sparked the Idle No More movement across Canada when the federal government in that country threatened to abrogate long-standing treaty rights of First Nations people. Idle No More has since gone international and continues to inspire opposition to extreme energy projects.\nHere in the San Francisco Bay Area, our Idle No More group working in solidarity with frontline refinery activists organized \xe2\x80\x9cConnect the Dots: Refinery Healing Walks\xe2\x80\x9d last year. These were a series of walks, one each month for four months, from seven to 14 miles each, from one refinery community to another. Led by Native American elders in prayer, these walks were highly successful in bringing awareness to the dangers of the refineries, the climate crisis the fossil fuel industry is causing and ways for people to get involved in solving the problems. We have made a commitment to organize the walks for a total of four years, with the last walk in 2017.\nOrganizing work continues on the ground in the refinery corridor, which has become an important destination for tar sands oil from Canada and fracked Bakken crude from North Dakota, both of which are highly polluting even by the norms of the oil industry. In this milieu, the predominantly people of color city of Richmond has become a focal point. Chevron is seeking a $1 billion expansion of its refinery there, which is already the largest stationary emitter of greenhouse gases in California. Years of community opposition have forced the world\xe2\x80\x99s 12th largest corporation to scale back the size of its proposed project while a progressive city government has pushed ahead with programs that emphasize clean energy systems and green jobs.\nOur struggle for climate justice in the Bay Area is just one example of what good people working together can do. We also must be prepared to join together for more large actions to show our commitment, our solidarity and our love for the continuance of life. We must be relentless, resilient, powerfully nonviolent and kind to one another. The beautiful future that we are all weaving together requires the best in us to create the best for those yet to come.\nPennie Opal Plant is a member of Idle No More San Francisco Bay.

Coal, oil and gas companies are wrecking the planet\xe2\x80\x99s climate and associating with them is no longer acceptable. Divest our endowment from these destructive companies.\nNew York University promotes itself as a \xe2\x80\x9csustainability leader.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s why student activists like myself have been pressuring the powers-that-be at NYU to live up to that claim. We want NYU to recognize the contradiction between its sustainability efforts and its environmentally damaging investments.\nOctober 16 was a landmark moment in our campaign. For the first time, we got to present the case for divestment to people with the institutional power to make it a reality. NYU has formed a \xe2\x80\x9cdivestment subcommittee\xe2\x80\x9d within the University Senate to consider our demand and on this day they heard us out.\nThis is good news for our campaign, but we did not get to this place without a struggle. After almost a year of trudging through NYU\xe2\x80\x99s narrow bureaucratic channels with little progress, we learned a valuable lesson: sometimes it takes escalation to be taken seriously.\nJohn Sexton, the president of NYU, ignored our request for a private meeting with him until we took direct action to call him out in public. At Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctown hall\xe2\x80\x9d meeting last April, we unraveled giant scrolls with more than 1,500 petition signatures calling on NYU to divest its $3 billion endowment. With so many concerned student, faculty and alumni names displayed so boldly, it was impossible for Sexton to ignore us any longer.\nThe action earned us a private meeting with both Sexton and NYU\xe2\x80\x99s chief financial officer Marty Dorph. Sexton agreed to our demands of 1) putting fossil fuel divestment on the University Senate agenda, 2) creating a subcommittee on divestment within the Financial Committee of the University Senate and 3) ensuring that we are able to present our proposal to the Board of Trustees in spring of 2015. These concessions are unprecedented for a student group at NYU.\nNYU\xe2\x80\x99s 66-member Board of Trustees is filled with 1 percenters from finance, real estate, corporate media and prestigious law firms. If we can get this elite group to publicly disavow the fossil fuel industry it will be big news for the movement. NYU would be by far the largest school to divest yet. It may seem unlikely, but with groups like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announcing that they will divest from fossil fuels, we are more hopeful than ever.\nMomentum is building. The People\xe2\x80\x99s Climate March inspired many new climate activists to get involved across the country, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the effects on campus. Our core membership has doubled in the past few weeks.\nFossil fuel divestment offers climate activists a tangible goal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a local approach to a global problem that goes beyond small lifestyle changes. We intend to change the public conversation. It\xe2\x80\x99s past time for people to see climate change as a moral and a political issue. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we draw inspiration from the anti-apartheid divestment movement of the 1980s. The tactic has proven effective before.\nCollege students are at the forefront of the divestment movement. This is unsurprising. Students have always been on the front lines of social change, but divestment is far more inclusive than that. Anyone who is part of a religious group or a labor union or lives in a city or state with a pension fund (i.e. just about everyone) can push for divestment in their community. To date, 181 institutions, including 13 U.S. universities, as well as more than 600 individuals have divested over $50 billion in fossil fuel assets. Your organization could be next.

The collapse of the industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s was cited in Forbes Magazine in 1985 as \xe2\x80\x9cthe largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe industry has never recovered, and, despite bullish projections of a nuclear renaissance made a decade ago, only a tiny handful of new reactors are under construction today. These are highly subsidized by both ratepayers and taxpayers, as Wall Street won\xe2\x80\x99t even consider investments as risky as new nukes without federal loan guarantees. They\xe2\x80\x99re also behind schedule and over budget.\nBut hope dies hard in the hearts, and on the balance sheets, of those companies pushing for a nuclear revival. And, in a time of growing concern over climate change, their public relations machine has been working overtime to brand nuclear as a green alternative to CO2-belching coal and gas. In the real world, however, nuclear is just too slow and expensive to effectively address the climate crisis, which requires dramatic\xc2\xa0reductions in CO2 emissions this decade. Solar, wind, other renewables and efficiency improvements \xe2\x80\x94 reducing the energy needed per function \xe2\x80\x94 are not only safer, but also faster and more affordable.\nThe climate movement is on the right track as it seeks to halt the expansion of fossil fuel exploration, extraction and transportation, and presses for the rapid phase-out of coal-fired power plants and other uses of carbon fuels throughout the economy.\nIt needs to be just as clear what it\xe2\x80\x99s for. This must be more than simply putting a price on carbon. Numerous studies, including those by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Ecofys looking at the global picture, as well as by Stanford engineering professor Mark Jacobson, who focused on the United States, have demonstrated the potential to phase out fossil fuels rapidly, reaching levels between 77 and 100 percent renewable by 2050. Accomplishing this, of course, requires focusing investment capital where it is most productive, and that means renewables and efficiency, not nuclear power.\nActivists need to build broad coalitions to push policies that will facilitate the rapid transition to a carbon-free and nuclear-free future. The United States must follow the lead of Germany, which has committed itself to both the conversion to renewables and the phase-out of all dirty energy, including nuclear power. They\xe2\x80\x99re succeeding in a much less sunny and windy location. Surely the renewable-rich United States can as well, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen by itself.\nThe climate movement needs to press for both incentives and mandates to increase investment in clean energy. The public generally supports green, renewable energy, and, when put to a vote, renewable energy standards (RES) usually score landslide wins. There is, however, growing pushback coming from the industry and Koch-funded groups including the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). They are pushing the repeal of RES laws via the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cElectricity Freedom Act.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAside from seeking more green energy through stronger RES laws, and opposing ALEC, activists can:\n\n\t\tSupport adoption of more stringent energy efficiency codes for both new and existing buildings.\n\n\t\tSupport net metering and feed-in tariffs incentivizing more distributed renewable generations.\n\n\t\tSupport utility-scale renewable energy projects, including offshore wind and the wheeling of power generated in wind-rich regions, like the High Plains, via efficient high-voltage DC lines.\n\n\t\tRally behind sustainable living education and projects to implement this in all aspects of life, from local food production to cycling, mass transit, eco-villages, etc.\nThe movement must work on public education, public policy, divestment campaigns and more to challenge the power of the fossil fuel industry, as well as to beat back false \xe2\x80\x9csolutions,\xe2\x80\x9d like nuclear power, that retard our ability to effectively address the climate crisis and present their own set of serious problems.\nMark Haim serves as director of Mid-Missouri Peaceworks in Columbia, Missouri, a grassroots nonprofit that does education and advocacy at the interface of peace, justice and sustainability.\nRELATED CONTENT\nClimate March Insider Looks Back: An Interview with Leslie Cagan\xe2\x80\x8bBy John Tarleton\nSpecial Indypendent Climate Issue, #200:\xc2\xa0Time for Action: Historic March for Climate Justice in NYC\nMayday for the Planet: Climate Change Resistance Comes to BushwickBy John Tarleton\nStep Up New York!

After the unarmed black teenager was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 and his body was left on the street for more than four hours, protests erupted. Those initial expressions of grief and rage have since grown into an organized national movement.\nDaily protests have taken place in Ferguson since Brown\xe2\x80\x99s death, punctuated by violent police crackdowns and the subsequent police killings in the Greater St. Louis Area of two other young black men, Vonderrit Myers, 18, and Kajiembe Powell, 25.\nDuring the weekend of October 10-13, thousands of St. Louis residents and out-of-towners took part in acts of resistance dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cFerguson October.\xe2\x80\x9d Demonstrators demanded the indictment of Brown\xe2\x80\x99s killer, Darren Wilson, and responded to systemic issues underlying the murder \xe2\x80\x94 racial bias and lack of accountability in law enforcement, normalized violence against communities of color, the militarization of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s police departments and more \xe2\x80\x94 with rallies, direct actions and civil disobedience. Dozens were arrested.\nTensions remain high in Ferguson. The grand jury deadline for a decision about Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s indictment is January 7, and as suspicions about the legitimacy of the process swirl through the community, people return day after day to protest at the local police station. In the recent words of one Ferguson resident, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one is going to rest until we get justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThousands participated in a \xe2\x80\x9cJustice for All\xe2\x80\x9d march in St. Louis on October 11. The march wound through downtown St. Louis and concluded with a rally at Kiener Plaza. The crowd numbered as many as 3,000 people and included local and out-of-state activists, people of faith, youth, labor union members and more.\nSt. Louis hip-hop artist Kareem Jackson, known as Tef Poe, speaks at the rally that followed the march while Ashley Yates, of Millennial Activists United, raises her arm in a Black Power salute to the crowd. Both have emerged as young leaders in the struggle for racial justice in the wake of Michael Brown\xe2\x80\x99s death.\nMessages at the march aired a multitude of grievances.\nOn Saturday, October 11, activists marched from the Michael Brown memorial by Canfield Green Apartments, where he was shot, to the Ferguson police station. Young and working-class black people emerged as leaders on the ground in Ferguson after Brown\xe2\x80\x99s death, coordinating much of the local response and challenging established civil rights figures and institutions in the process.\nA young woman decries being seen as a target because of her brown skin.\xc2\xa0\nIn what has become a defining gesture of the Ferguson protests, participants in the march raise up both arms.\nOn October 12, protesters gathered near the convenience store where 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers Jr. was killed by an off-duty police officer on October 8. Here, Vonderrit Myers Sr. holds a photograph of his son and the teen\xe2\x80\x99s mother. After the rally, protesters marched through the streets and ended the night with a sit-in at least 1,000 strong at St. Louis University. Seventeen others were arrested that night after doing a sit-in at another convenience store.\nProtesters march from the store on Shaw Avenue where Vonderrit Myers was killed to the center of the Shaw neighborhood in St. Louis.\nIn a twist on the now-popular Ferguson protest chant, \xe2\x80\x9cThey think it\xe2\x80\x99s a game, they think it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d marchers block an intersection in the Shaw neighborhood by playing jump rope and hopscotch.\nOctober 13 was dubbed by Ferguson October organizers as a \xe2\x80\x9cMoral Monday\xe2\x80\x9d of civil disobedience, alluding to ongoing \xe2\x80\x9cMoral Monday\xe2\x80\x9d actions that began in North Carolina last year and have since spread to other states. Clergy leaders and others, including philosopher Cornel West, led a march to the Ferguson police station on the morning of October 13.\nProtesters drew an outline of a body in white and yellow chalk in the Ferguson police station parking lot to memorialize Michael Brown.\nMembers of the clergy kneeled in front of police in riot gear at the Ferguson police station, praying and asking the police to repent in the pouring rain.

But where is all this focus for the black on black teens getting shot and killed.. Why does everything have to be about BLAME WHITE PEOPLE. I never did anything to anyone yet I am guilty because I am white. I was born guilty. And it is total BS. This is all about the black community not taking responsibility for their actions and turning everything into a race issue and focus on the effects not the cause. They break the law and try and kill cops and get killed and because the cop didn\'t die he is the bad guy. Sorry But I lived in the ghetto and I have seen first hand how crazy black on black crime is. They use to beat on me and jump me and stab and shoot me all the time because we where the only white family in the hood. Where are my protesters for what was done to me??.. Where is the focus on the kid\'s that the black drug dealers set on fire to send a message to their parents. Where are their protests? Where is the focus on that. There will be no attention there because of the huge double standard that exists that says ""Only Black Lives Matter"". Black lives only matter if shot by a white person. No matter the reason a black person is shot.. There is a grand father who shot and killed a black teen that was ripping his grand daughters clothes off to rape her and shot the old man and was going to kill them both after they raped the girl.. And the man managed to shoot all 3 and killed one of them. Yet the focus is on the 89 year old man who shot and killed a black teen. No one cares about why he shoot them. They only care because it was a white person who pulled the trigger. It does not matter he saved his life his wife and his granddaughter. It only matters that he is the bad guy and it\'s a race issue now. And it makes me sick. Stop breaking the law and stop thinking you are above the law and take responsibility for your actions and focus on the cause of these issues not the aftermath. Lord help these people.. Because they need it!. Oh and of course it\'s not racist for blacks to kill white people shoot them insult them or steal their stuff and cry about white person this white person that.

Running between cars, we slapped high-fives with drivers and held signs above our heads.\nOn December 3, thousands flooded the New York streets after news broke that Pantaleo had not been indicted after murdering Garner. It was the second time in 10 days that a grand jury refused to charge a white cop who killed an unarmed Black man. On November 24 officer Darren Wilson was cleared in the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The two non-indictments, back to back, ignited our sadness into rage; again we saw deadly abuses of power go unpunished.\nProtesters march from NYC\'s Foley Square toward the Brooklyn Bridge on December 4, the day after the Eric Garner verdict was announced.\nEven as I write this, somewhere in America a Black man or woman is being beaten or killed by the police. Most die invisibly. For a few, a rough video of their assault or death will surface and their faces will be framed in protest signs. Each new murder swells the movement that compels us to stage mass die-ins in transit hubs and malls, torch stores and block highways. The people are rising against the state, demanding justice it cannot give and the state cannot crush the protests without risking more rebellion.\nA great collision is coming, driven by a question that has been asked repeatedly for nearly four centuries. It was asked by 19 Africans, enslaved in the English colony of Jamestown in 1619, and is being asked again by the protesters across the nation. Can Black life be valued in America?\nWhy Ferguson Matters\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see your driver\xe2\x80\x99s license,\xe2\x80\x9d the cop told me.

They watch us.\nNYPD cops man a police barricade during the second night of protests over a Staten Island grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner.\nBut the crime they see is a warped vision of the crime that exists. In the eyes of U.S. police, criminality is visible if contrasted against brown skin. While patrolling highways and streets, they miss vast amounts of ongoing crime committed by whites and especially, wealthy whites. Let the suspect be Black and they will be stopped and frisked, their car inspected, their papers run through the system. The NAACP Criminal Justice Fact Sheet states that white people use illegal drugs five times more often than Black people even though Blacks are jailed at 10 times the rate.\nThe police crisscross Black, Latino, poor and immigrant neighborhoods and come down hardest on those that are most vulnerable. In Gotham alone, during the 12 years of Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, the New York Civil Liberties Union reported that the New York Police Department (NYPD) conducted nearly 5 million stops and frisks. A quarter of them involved young Black men, who comprise less than 2 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s population.\xc2\xa0\nThe goal remains the same under liberal Mayor Bill de Blasio as it was under Bloomberg. It was best summed up by Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s top cop Ray Kelly, who said to state Senator Eric Adams that he wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cinstill fear in them [Black youth] that every time that they left their homes they could be targeted by police.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe police don\xe2\x80\x99t just want to watch us; they want us to know it and to internalize it and watch ourselves, afraid that the smallest misdemeanor can begin an unstoppable descent toward prison. After I was arrested, my time came for court. The officers took me out of the cell and drove me to the judge. As we talked, I asked them about this mass arrest policy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call it the snowball effect,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, it just begins small like a ticket and then another citation, some jail time and next thing you know\xe2\x80\xa6boom!\xe2\x80\x9d I slumped back in the seat, dizzy with anger and blurted, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a name for how bad it is why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stop it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolicy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said and looked away. \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd every time a cop stops and frisks us, harasses us for sleeping on the train, writes a ticket, embarrasses us in public \xe2\x80\x94 it traumatizes the body, fills it with combustible pain. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand if you don\xe2\x80\x99t experience it. Remember Eric Garner telling the police officers, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease just leave me alone\xe2\x80\x9d? Did you know he brought a civil suit against the NYPD for doing a cavity search for drugs in 2007, right in broad daylight as people walked by? Nothing was found. He wrote of the \xe2\x80\x9cinjuries to his manhood\xe2\x80\x9d caused by the officer searching his rectum and genitals for \xe2\x80\x9chis own personal pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFerguson matters because every city in America has a Ferguson inside it. A people enraged at the handprints left by police on their bodies, losing money to tickets, losing jobs to jail time, burying the dead and then being blamed for it. The flames in that small town can spread across the nation. Malcolm X once joked that during slavery, when the master\xe2\x80\x99s house caught fire, field slaves prayed for wind. Many of us are praying now.\nThe Feedback Loop of Violence\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack on black crime is the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community,\xe2\x80\x9d former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press in November. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite police officers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t killing each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\nConservatives say the high Black crime rate is the real danger, not rogue white cops. The danger is gangsta rap or single mothers or dumb hood drama. Biological racism in which one race is better than others has been replaced with cultural racism in which one culture is better than another. Conservatives believe in hierarchy, an order that keeps everyone in their proper place. Black culture is the low point in that hierarchy; it is a cauldron of icky morals, drowning everyone in it or close by.\nJason Riley, a Black writer at the Wall Street Journal who wrote Please Stop Helping Us, followed this tradition in his article \xe2\x80\x9cThe Other Ferguson Tragedy.\xe2\x80\x9d He wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cHomicide is the leading cause of death among young black men, who are 10 times more likely than their white counterparts to be murdered. And while you\xe2\x80\x99d never know it watching MSNBC, the police are not to blame.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Black homicide rate is part of a feedback loop of oppression. It\xe2\x80\x99s the effect of multiple forces, but is framed by conservatives as a cause. The first of these forces is poverty. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\xe2\x80\x99 August jobs report said the Black unemployment rate is at 11 percent, compared to the 5.3 percent rate for whites. During the four decades the bureau has kept records on it, Black unemployment has always been higher, a sign that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with intergenerational poverty. Nearly 30 percent of Black people are poor. If you do the math, it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly 13 million people out of 42 million.\nThe image of urban ghettos that resemble warzones is a staple in the public imagination. What the protests in Ferguson show is that segregation followed people of color into the suburbs. Brown University sociologist John Logan described in a recent report, \xe2\x80\x9cSeparate and Unequal in Suburbia,\xe2\x80\x9d the movement of people of color from cities into the older inner rings of suburbs, and the poverty many of them live with. It is often reflected in failing schools that are underfunded, understaffed and have low graduation rates.\nAnd then there\xe2\x80\x99s geography. Much of urban crime is public. Poor families are packed into small apartments and that density \xe2\x80\x9csqueezes\xe2\x80\x9d crime out into public space. Beefs start in the street. Drug dealing and addiction are in the street. The fight for turf is in the street. All of which makes it visible and easier to police.\xc2\xa0\nMuch of suburban crime, on the other hand, is private. Drug use, sexual assault and violence happen inside homes, where the police don\xe2\x80\x99t often go. Waves of crime roll through the suburbs but go unreported, giving white America a false veneer of safety and innocence. That veneer is being blown apart by the hashtag #crimingwhilewhite, where whites describe their crimes and the soft treatment they\xe2\x80\x99ve received from police.\nSuburban neighborhoods of color, however, don\xe2\x80\x99t get this \xe2\x80\x9cbenign neglect.\xe2\x80\x9d As the crisis in Ferguson blew up, the New York Times editorialized, \xe2\x80\x9cThe police in St. Louis County\xe2\x80\x99s many municipalities systematically target poor and minority citizens for street and traffic stops \xe2\x80\x94 partly to generate fines \xe2\x80\x94 which has the effect of both bankrupting and criminalizing whole communities.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPolice are overpolicing poor neighborhoods of color. Decades ago, Black and Latino neighborhoods were neglected, something rapper Flavor Flav of Public Enemy made fun of in his song \xe2\x80\x9c911 is a Joke\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I dialed 911 a long time ago. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see how late they\xe2\x80\x99re reactin\xe2\x80\x99. They only come and they come when they wanna.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe switch to overpolicing accompanied the rise of the \xe2\x80\x9cbroken windows\xe2\x80\x9d theory, which compels law enforcement to target low-level crimes. As the logic goes, going after low-level offenders will prevent larger crimes. Nice in theory, but in practice it creates the \xe2\x80\x9csnowball\xe2\x80\x9d effect. Danette Chavis of National Action Against Police Brutality said, \xe2\x80\x9cBlacks and Hispanics are arrested on the accusation of a crime. They keep them in jail and tell them\xe2\x80\xa6if you plead the lesser charge we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the trick\xe2\x80\xa6once you cop a plea you just got got by the city. Now you got a record, you deemed as a criminal which will serve as your death warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd then there is the conservative cult of the individual. When liberals point at the structural oppression in society, it\xe2\x80\x99s ballyhooed as an evasion of personal responsibility. But crime, particularly robbery and gang-related homicide, is a form of agency. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a reactionary one. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the leftist goal of making society more equal. It reflects the conservative vision of an isolated self, driven by personal gain.\nThe Strain Theory in sociology posits that if an individual believes in the goals of society but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the means to attain them, crime can be the result. A very clear parallel exists between Horatio Alger\xe2\x80\x99s rags-to-riches novel, Ragged Dick, and Jay-Z\xe2\x80\x99s rap career \xe2\x80\x94 except in Jigga\xe2\x80\x99s case he got \xe2\x80\x9chis\xe2\x80\x9d by selling drugs as a youth and then rapping about it as an adult. A dimension of Black crime exists that is not a threat against capitalism but a celebration of it.\nAnd finally there is our gun culture. We\xe2\x80\x99ve drooled over guns ever since European settlers expanded westward in North America and massacred the indigenous peoples they found in their way. The gun was and remains a symbol of freedom, so it circulates with little regulation and flows into poor neighborhoods. Some 300 million guns exist in America. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d problem, but the problems Black people face, like poverty, depression and rage, become more dangerous when a gun is used to solve them.\xc2\xa0\nYet these effects of structural racism and economic inequality get turned around and recycled as a cause. After his NBC interview, Giuliani doubled down and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there were a lot of murders in a community, we put a lot of police officers there. If I had put all my police officers on Park Avenue and none in Harlem, thousands and thousands more blacks would have been killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe needed jobs, not cops. We needed affordable housing, not cops. We needed gun laws. We needed drug rehabilitation centers and childcare. We still do.\xc2\xa0\nProtesters hold a die-in in the middle of Grand Central Terminal to commemorate the death of Eric Garner.\nLicense to Kill\nThat police have a license to kill is a social fact. Compare two cases. In November 2012, 47-year-old Michael Dunn, who was not a cop, got into a yelling match over loud music with four Black teens in a car. He pulled out a gun and shot at them, killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis. He said it seemed Davis was pulling out a gun. But no weapon was found. Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder.\xc2\xa0\nThis December Phoenix police officer Mark Rine shot and killed 34-year-old Rumain Brisbon after mistaking a bottle of pills in his pocket for a gun. He was Black, and no gun was found on him either. Considering how hard it\xe2\x80\x99s proven to be to indict a cop, Rine probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be held accountable.\xc2\xa0\nThe reason is that officers represent the state, which has a monopoly on legitimate violence. And that legitimacy is derived from it being the only supposedly neutral and universal social body that in an electoral democracy represents everyone equally. It comes from the consent of the governed.\xc2\xa0\nYet in practice the state plays an inherently conservative role. It maintains law and order in an unequal society, so the contradictions roil it from inside. It must suppress the very people who are the source of its legitimacy. And it does this by shielding its own agents from public accountability while demonizing its victims. The formula is the same for the cops who shoot unarmed civilians, the CIA agents who torture detainees and the drone pilots who kill innocent people while targeting terrorists. Up and down the chain of command, an aura of untouchability obscures abuses of power.\nA woman shares her thoughts with New York\xe2\x80\x99s Finest.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee\xe2\x80\x99s report on the CIA\xe2\x80\x99s use of torture exposed instances of detainees being beaten, force-fed though their anuses, chained to walls in stress positions and denied sleep for days. It also revealed that President Bush was told about the \xe2\x80\x9cfull nature\xe2\x80\x9d of the torture in April 2006. Yet he said on camera in October 2007, \xe2\x80\x9cThis government does not torture people.\xe2\x80\x9d\nYou know he won\xe2\x80\x99t be indicted. The president embodies the same unaccountable violence as the cop in the street. And today, even as President Obama directs muted calls for calm toward Black people dealing with police violence, he inflicts it on people of color overseas. Obama is the Darren Wilson of the world.\nCrime and Innocence\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiller cops must go to jail,\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Franclot Graham, the father of Ramarley Graham, a Black teen who in 2012 was chased by the NYPD into his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s home without a warrant and shot dead. No gun was found, just a small bag of weed. On Saturday, December 13, tens of thousands of New Yorkers came out for the Millions March against police brutality in Manhattan. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to jail,\xe2\x80\x9d Graham said, referring to the police officer who killed his son. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to jail!\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd repeated.\xc2\xa0\nThe call for justice is building in Black America and beyond. Players for the St. Louis Rams came onto the football field with their hands up in honor of Michael Brown. LeBron James wore a shirt on court that read, \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d The burgeoning movement, led by young Black activists, is challenging the narrative of crime and innocence in America. It\xe2\x80\x99s flipping the script, using the social consensus about the preciousness of life to challenge the hypocrisy of the state.\xc2\xa0\nOccupy Wall Street exposed the guilt of elites as they waged class war on the poor. Feminists have targeted colleges and the military, exposing male supremacy and the epidemic of rape hidden from view in these institutions. Fast-food workers are calling out the economic violence they endure as their bosses make astronomical profits. Everywhere people are laying claim to universal values and marshalling them against the institutions that have exploited those values as an alibi for their power.\nIt begins not with ideas but experience. If you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why this new movement is happening, let me ask you to look at your hands. For a moment, please think of the person you love most in this life. Imagine holding them. Take a slow breath; exhale everything but them from your mind. Maybe you see a lover, a sibling or a parent. Can you almost feel the warmth of their skin?\nKeep looking at your hands, holding the person you love. Now imagine them killed. And the murderer walking away. Do you feel helpless? Do you feel sadness weighing in your body?\nThe heaviness in your palms is what we lift to the sky. Cops who kill unarmed Black men go free, one after the other. It\xe2\x80\x99s why we march through the streets yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cHands up, don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s why we shout the names of our dead. We show our hands because we\xe2\x80\x99re scared of being killed by officers who have been given license to kill Black people and go unpunished.\xc2\xa0\nI\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to take this weight from us. I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to hold your hands up too.\xc2\xa0\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n""Learning from the Past, Building for the Future""\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tBy Matthew\xc2\xa0Birkhold\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\n""Revolution by Design""\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tBy John\xc2\xa0Tarleton\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n'",b'\n',b'12/19/2014 - 3:52am',b'Thank you for writing an article inclusive of all aspects of this fight. Danette Chavis -National Action Against Police Brutality!\n',"b'December 16, 2014'","b'Since the failure of a Ferguson grand jury to indict Darren Wilson I have been amazed by the way my Facebook newsfeed has been filled with people talking about attending demonstrations, die-ins and marches. People who have long rejected my urging to become active are now attending demonstrations more consistently than I am. As the murder of Emmett Till and the acquittal of his killers politicized the generation of people who built the black power movement, the failure to indict the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner is politicizing a new generation. Because much of the black power and 1968 generation is still with us, this moment presents an incredible opportunity for younger organizers to learn from older ones about what they did well and what they could have done differently.\xc2\xa0\n\n\tI came of age politically in the early 2000s in anti-racist campus politics and then in the National Hip-Hop Political Convention. Since then I have been fortunate enough to have a number of relationships with older and experienced movement activists to whom I have long turned to for discussions of movement activity. People like Grace Lee Bogs, Tony Monteiro, Muhammad Ahmad, Rod Bush, Melanie Bush, Richard Feldman and Shea Howell are but a few of the experienced movement folks with who have taught me to analyze movement dynamics in important ways. These people have all provided me with an understanding of how people come to recognize the importance of strategy, theory and the importance and limitations of spontaneity. We have never agreed on everything and there is no reason we should. Our disagreements have taught me that divergent views are important and critical to building movements.\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\n\tThese are movement building times. People are coming to demonstrations, marching and blocking traffic for the first time in their lives. They feel empowered by activity, and this feeling is creating momentum. As long as this momentum grows, the movement will grow. As the movement grows, spokespeople and new leadership will develop. Disagreements will emerge over fundamental questions, issues, strategies and tactics.\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\n\tYounger movement builders need to know that they do not have to navigate these developments alone and older movement builders who are still alive need to assume responsibility for helping younger activists navigate. Had Ella Baker not assumed responsibility for nurturing student activists in the early 1960s, it is likely that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) would not have emerged and played a leading role in the Southern freedom struggle. Without SNCC, the world we live in today would be far more unjust than it is.\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\n\tWe all have much to learn from Baker\xe2\x80\x99s relationship to SNCC. Baker, who already had three decades of grassroots organizing experience at the time of SNCC\xe2\x80\x99s founding in 1960, was able to make the contribution she did because young activists were receptive to her and knew they needed experienced mentors. While young activists must exercise humility, older activists must recognize that one reason Baker was successful was her willingness to learn from young people and insist that they be autonomous.\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\n\tMany of us have been politicized in a world where nonprofit work has dominated the activist landscape. We often expect to be paid for our work and look for ways to turn activist work into income. There is certainly nothing wrong with getting paid for movement work. Yet, doing movement work within the corporate structure of nonprofits and universities means that younger activists are less likely to be critical of movement activity guided by capitalist values than we need to be. Movements get built and grow when people feel their humanity growing. They often often start dying when money flows into people\'s pockets.\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\n\tSeeing people become politically active and gaining a sense of their power to transform the world is a beautiful thing. As people who have previously felt powerless begin to feel powerful, all kinds of contradictions emerge. If young movement builders are able to build relationships with older movement builders now, before those contradictions become capable of stunting the movement\xe2\x80\x99s growth, we can collectively learn to utilize those contradictions in ways that will generate new ideas and relationships and transform us and the world we so desperately want to change.\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\n\nMatt Birkhold is former executive director of the Brecht Forum and author of the short forthcoming book, Growing Our Souls: Visionary Organizing to Create the World Anew.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n""Take the Chains Off: The Movement Continues""By Nicholas Powers\n""Revolution by Design""By John Tarleton\n\n'",b'\n',"b'December 16, 2014'","b'For the past 40 years the Democratic Party establishment has relentlessly pursued \xe2\x80\x9ccentrist\xe2\x80\x9d politics that allow them to follow the Republicans ever further to the right. To the frustration of the party\xe2\x80\x99s voting base, this has meant backing corporate-friendly economic policies, offering hawkish support for the Pentagon and its wars, a half-hearted defense of the environment and an aversion to embracing controversial social issues like gay marriage and marijuana legalization until they become impossible to ignore.\xc2\xa0\nWhen Barack Obama successfully campaigned for the White House in 2008, he raised the hopes of millions of his supporters that he would bring sweeping change to Washington. Three weeks after his election and with the economy in free fall, Time Magazine\xe2\x80\x99s cover famously depicted Obama as FDR, down to the jaunty smile and the cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The headline read, \xe2\x80\x9cThe New New Deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s been no such thing. Obama quickly filled key administration posts with retreads from the Clinton years. And six years later exhaustion with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tepid liberalism found expression in the 2014 midterm elections, which saw the Democrats lose control of the Senate and get trounced across much of the country.\nThe Republicans are no more popular than before as they continue to play to an aging, white and conservative voting base. However, with the exception of African-Americans, groups that lean Democrat, such as young people, union members, single women and Hispanics, stayed away in droves and voter turnout for a national election plummeted to the lowest level since 1942.\xc2\xa0\nThe Big Winner\nThe big winner in the midterms was radicalism. And radicalism has no ideological flags. The Right can seize mass disaffection with Wall Street and the political system. But the Left lacks the fire to claim that rage and repeats the tired refrain of a New New Deal, backing away from any aggressive radical reform ideas such as a shorter workweek, guaranteed basic income and a single-payer health care system.\xc2\xa0\nThe GOP capitalized cleverly on profound working- and middle-class rage, especially against the administration\xe2\x80\x99s failure to deal effectively with the economic slump that has, despite official figures to the contrary, rendered about 20 million workers either unemployed or stuck in part-time or contingent jobs. Add the millions who have given up looking for paid work either because there are no jobs or the jobs that do exist are offered for wages and hours that are below poverty levels. Neither mainstream Republicans nor their Tea Party radical wing have any intention of providing solutions that would benefit those most seriously hurt by what may be described as a \xe2\x80\x9cmanaged\xe2\x80\x9d depression. But their rhetorical thrust did articulate working-class complaints and mobilized the still-formidable right-wing base.\xc2\xa0\nThe Democrats were also hard-pressed to defend the Affordable Care Act, when they bothered to do so at all. The Republicans argued that it was not truly affordable for a large fraction of the population and enlarged the power of the federal government beyond constitutional limits. In general the left-liberals defended the law, which was modeled on a similar program enacted in 2006 by Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts. They ignored the fact that Obamacare is an immense giveaway to large insurance companies, permits huge deductibles for many people and mostly forces people into managed care programs. The administration and its supporters have argued that Obamacare is a qualified success. Many people are skeptical of this claim and the Democrats paid the price.\nThe Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, meanwhile, has evolved into a permanent war program. He has authorized the bombing of seven different Arab and/or Muslim nations. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan inherited from the Bush administration rage on. Americans were unhappily reminded of this over the summer when the Islamic State overran much of northern and western Iraq while the U.S.-backed government in Baghdad stood by helplessly.\nBeholden to their wealthy funders just like the Republicans, the Democrats stood for nothing that could inspire people and the midterm elections became a referendum on the failings of the Obama administration.\nLonging For The New Deal\nThere is a recurring proposal heard among left-liberals: radicalize the Democratic Party by restoring it to its New Deal glory days. The genius of the New Deal was to have shifted the locus of political power to a federal center that promised, and partially delivered, the elements of security: unemployment benefits, Social Security, low-cost post-secondary education and a state-sponsored workers\xe2\x80\x99 right to organize unions. This final right was codified into law following an epic wave of industrial strikes and factory occupations in the mid-1930s.\nThe past 40 years have brought a reversal of state paternalism. While successive governments strengthened the military and urban police departments in the wake of the 1960s-era urban uprisings among blacks, the social welfare functions of government have been considerably weakened, leading to a widening gap between the very rich and the rest of us. While the Democrats enacted programs that created a relatively large black middle class, their passivity and at times aggressive support of the deindustrialization of America that began in the 1970s has left in its wake massive poverty in black, Latino and industrial Southern white communities. After six years in office, the Obama administration still fervently backs austerity policies that have impoverished growing sections of the population and, perhaps equally important, have weakened, if not entirely rescinded, the American Dream.\xc2\xa0\nThe recurring dream of restoring the New Deal can be heard in calls for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to challenge Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries. This ignores the fact that the Democrats receive billions of dollars in corporate cash every election cycle and that those donors expect a good return on their investment.\nLearning from Ferguson\nIn the present situation, our best hope lies in disruptive social movements that operate outside the two-party system. When oppositional movements gain sufficient strength and are able to break into the public consciousness, the conventional wisdom about what is possible can begin to shift and open up the space for changes in policy.\xc2\xa0\nThe anti-police brutality protests that began in Ferguson, Missouri, in August provide a strong example. These protests have since spread to more than 100 cities following decisions by grand juries to not indict the police officers who killed Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Protesters have taken over highways and bridges in a number of major cities and disrupted the jingle-jangle of holiday cash registers by holding \xe2\x80\x9cdie-ins\xe2\x80\x9d inside major shopping malls.\xc2\xa0\nThese actions have sparked an intense national conversation about police accountability and the role of racism in police practices. To date, the reforms being offered \xe2\x80\x94 such as requiring police officers to wear video cameras \xe2\x80\x94 are fairly modest. But if these protests persist and gather more strength, the opportunity to affect more far-reaching changes in police practices could emerge.\nJust as Ferguson put the plague of racially biased police killings on the map, in 2011 the Occupy movement, with its battle cry of \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the 99%!,\xe2\x80\x9d brought economic inequality to the fore. While Occupy quickly fizzled, it helped prepare the ground for a series of wildcat strikes by fast-food workers demanding $15 an hour and a union.\xc2\xa0\nThese walkouts have energized efforts to raise the minimum wage across the country. This fall ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage passed in conservative bastions like Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. Earlier this year, Seattle approved an ordinance to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next several years. Kshama Sawant, an unabashed socialist and former Occupy activist, championed the measure after making it the centerpiece of her 2013 upset victory, which made her the first socialist elected to the Seattle City Council in almost a century.\nThe movement for marriage equality started from the political margins and won increasing acceptance in the past decade with very little help from the Democrats until it was already obvious which way history was moving. Acceptance for legalized marijuana has followed a similar trajectory, though in the case of pot most Democrats are still reluctant to embrace it out of fear they will be tarred as \xe2\x80\x9csoft on crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHere in New York, vibrant movements opposing fracking and the growing corporate attacks on our public school system helped spur the Green Party gubernatorial campaign of Howie Hawkins and Brian Jones, which received almost 5 percent of the vote running against incumbent Democrat Andrew Cuomo, the best any independent third party campaign has done statewide in more than 80 years.\xc2\xa0\nBuilding a third political party that can seriously challenge the major party duopoly is extremely difficult in this country for a number of reasons. Ultimately the spark for successful third party politics as well as a host of other changes we urgently need to see will come from independent left movements or from nowhere at all.\nStanley Aronowitz is a Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the CUNY Graduate Center.

This trend started in 1980's and has continued to strengthen as local working class voters constantly vote against their best interest. In observing this along with the disappearance of a viable  Democratic Party the need for a representative third party has become a necessity. My local group is seeking support for the development of an Independence Party that will provide local candidates who are not tied to the stigmas that our national parties present. These candidates can offer local voters a platform that meets their needs and thus reverse much of the damage that our local and state politicians have legislated in recent years. Our group feels a successful third party movement must start locally fist and build on its successes before challenging the more powerful resistance any third party movement will face at the state and national level. Any support or suggestions would be appreciated.\n""","b'December 16, 2014'","b'Season\xe2\x80\x99s greetings! It\xe2\x80\x99s time to open up those wallets and hand over your credit cards to the hackers who have been raiding some of America\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks and retailers.\xc2\xa0\nYou may remember that around this time last year, when Americans were out doing their holiday shopping, Target, one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest retailers, was the victim of the then-largest retail data heist in history. Hackers broke into the company\xe2\x80\x99s servers and siphoned off 40 million credit card numbers.\nSince then, reports of massive data breaches have piled up like presents under a Christmas tree. Neiman Marcus, Kmart, Dairy Queen, SuperValu and UPS experienced hacks this year. In September, it was revealed that 56 million credit card numbers were stolen from Home Depot\xe2\x80\x99s servers, an operation that was even larger than the one that occurred at Target.\xc2\xa0\nPart of the reason these hacks keep happening is that retailers just don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to take cybersecurity seriously. An investigation of the Home Depot and Target breaches found the companies missed several red flags that provided opportunities to prevent or reduce the damage.\nCraig Spiezle, executive director of the Online Trust Alliance, told The Indypendent that many companies do not have the proper alarms and response plans in place to catch the hackers and then react quickly to halt the attack.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom a security perspective, you recognize that you need to take steps to prevent a breach from happening. But you also have to have steps in place to catch when it happens and then [know] what to do about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of Target, it became like the Titanic. They could go from one data hole to another and then ultimately bring the company down.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\nIn an analysis published in January of 500 data breaches, the Online Trust Alliance found that 89 percent of them could have been prevented.\xc2\xa0\nAccording to a recent Ponemon Institute report, which was sponsored by the information service company Experian, 27 percent of companies don\xe2\x80\x99t have a data breach response plan in place, even though cyberattacks increased by more than 10 percent from 2013 to 2014.\xc2\xa0\nBut even if you do everything right, breaches can and will happen. Despite having one of the most sophisticated and expensive security systems on Wall Street, banking goliath JPMorgan Chase announced in September that hackers had penetrated its defenses and extracted the emails, phone numbers and addresses of more than 76 million households and 8 million businesses. However, more recent reports suggest that the hack may have affected other banks and that the full scale of the heist is still unknown.\xc2\xa0\nThe incident highlighted the inadequacy of U.S. cybercrime regulations. Currently, there are no federal laws that define what type of information needs to be stolen in order for a company to report a breach. Banks are only required to notify customers if the incident caused them a financial loss. Hence the confusion and difficulty in determining the scale of the JPMorgan hack.\xc2\xa0\nSeveral bills have been introduced in Congress that would establish data breach notification requirements to protect consumer data, but none of them have garnered much support.\xc2\xa0\nInstead, companies must comply with cybercrime-related laws in 47 different states that set different definitions of what constitutes a data breach and how a company is supposed to respond. Because the Internet has no borders, Spiezle said that it is time-consuming and enormously expensive for companies to hire law firms to navigate the different regulations.\nHowever, in what appears to be a sign that private industry is starting to take cybercrime more seriously, more than 40 trade associations representing retailers and merchants sent a letter to Congress in November demanding federal legislation that would address data breaches.\xc2\xa0\nThe letter urged lawmakers to \xe2\x80\x9cact to standardize reasonable, timely notification of sensitive data breaches whenever and wherever they occur.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile Spiezle said he agrees that federal data breach legislation should be a priority and that it would make sense for a federal law to preempt state laws, he worried that the trade associations behind the letter would try to set the bar so high that a company would not have to report a data breach unless it affected 100,000 customers or more. In contrast, a bill co-authored by Democratic Senator Edward J. Markey would require companies to report a breach that affected more than 5,000 customers. California law, meanwhile, requires companies to notify the state attorney general if a breach compromised the personal information of more than 500 Californians.\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil\xe2\x80\x99s in the details,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spiezle. \xe2\x80\x9cThe trade groups want to minimize the ability of anyone coming after them so they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have state rights enforced. So this is where the rub comes in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to look at what\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing and get it done and get past this gridlock and the special interest groups that really want to have it so watered down that it becomes ineffective,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\nAccording to another Ponemon Institute study, which was sponsored by IBM, the cost of data breaches in the United States was $201 per person in 2014. While banks protect customers against fraudulent credit card charges, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the public won\xe2\x80\x99t eventually pick up the tab.\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is more fraud, costs go up,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeffrey MacKie-Mason, dean of the School of Information at the University of Michigan, said via email. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of that price increase will likely be in annual customer fees or interest rates affecting cardholders; some of it will likely be in higher merchant fees, affecting retailers. Everyone is affected by the higher cost of doing business, regardless of where the law assigns liability.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut the cost of cyberfraud is insignificant compared to what could be on the horizon. The JPMorgan attack demonstrated that hackers could be capable of infiltrating the United States\xe2\x80\x99s largest financial institutions, with potentially serious consequences.\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could see a financial collapse and resulting great depression \xe2\x80\x94 or worse \xe2\x80\x94 from a sufficiently serious cybercrime. Such crimes might, for example, be perpetrated not just by profit-seeking criminals, but by nation states who want to bring down the economy of other countries,\xe2\x80\x9d said MacKie-Mason.\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the financial system that\xe2\x80\x99s at risk. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued several reports indicating that hackers could cause enormous harm to all aspects of the country\xe2\x80\x99s critical infrastructure. The GAO has repeatedly recommended that the federal government make cybersecurity a national priority.\xc2\xa0\nDespite these warnings, in 2012 John McCain led a group of Senate Republicans in defeating a bill that would have created new standards to oversee cyberthreats to America\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure. They argued that the law imposed too much of a financial burden for companies to follow.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn general, if we look at just our Congress we seem to have the inability to do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Spiezle said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredible that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get together on this issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'",b'\n',"b'January 26, 2015'","b""In most of the liberal discussions of the recent police killings of unarmed black men, there is an underlying assumption that the police are supposed to protect and serve the population. That is, after all, what they were created to do. Maybe there are a few bad apples, but if only the police weren\xe2\x80\x99t so racist, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t carry out policies like stop-and-frisk, or weren\xe2\x80\x99t so afraid of black people, or shot fewer unarmed men, they could function as a useful service that we all need.\nThis liberal way of viewing the problem rests on a misunderstanding of the origins of the police and what they were created to do. The police were not created to protect and serve the population. They were not created to stop crime, at least not as most people understand it. And they were certainly not created to promote justice. They were created to protect the new form of wage-labor capitalism that emerged in the mid- to\xc2\xa0late-19th\xc2\xa0century from the threat posed by that system\xe2\x80\x99s offspring, the working class.\nBefore the\xc2\xa019th\xc2\xa0century, there were no police forces that we would recognize as such anywhere in the world. In the northern United States, there was a system of elected constables and sheriffs, much more responsible to the population in a very direct way than the police are today. In the South, the closest thing to a police force was the slave patrols. Then, as Northern cities grew and filled with mostly immigrant wage workers who were physically and socially separated from the ruling class, the wealthy elite who ran the various municipal governments hired hundreds and then thousands of armed men to impose order on the new working-class neighborhoods.\nClass conflict roiled\xc2\xa0late-19th\xc2\xa0century American cities like Chicago, which experienced major strikes and riots in 1867, 1877, 1886 and 1894. In each of these upheavals, the police attacked strikers with extreme violence. In the aftermath of these movements, the police increasingly presented themselves as a thin blue line protecting civilization, by which they meant bourgeois civilization, from the disorder of the working class. This ideology has been reproduced ever since \xe2\x80\x94 except that today, poor black and Latino people rather than immigrant workers are the main threat.\nOf course, the ruling class did not get everything it wanted. It had to yield on many points to the immigrant workers it sought to control \xe2\x80\x94 this is why, for instance, municipal governments backed away from trying to stop Sunday drinking and why they hired so many immigrant police officers, especially the Irish. But despite these concessions, businessmen organized themselves to make sure the police were increasingly isolated from democratic control. The police, meanwhile, increasingly set themselves off from the population by donning uniforms; establishing their own rules for hiring, promotion and firing; working to build a unique\xc2\xa0esprit de corps;\xc2\xa0and identifying themselves with order. And despite complaints about corruption and inefficiency, they gained more and more support from the ruling class, to the extent that in Chicago, for instance, businessmen donated money to buy the police rifles, artillery, Gatling guns and buildings and to establish a police pension out of their own pockets.\nThere was a never a time when the big city police neutrally enforced \xe2\x80\x9cthe law\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 nor, for that matter, a time when the law itself was neutral. Throughout the\xc2\xa019th\xc2\xa0century in the North, the police mostly arrested people for the vaguely defined \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes\xe2\x80\x9d of disorderly conduct and vagrancy, which meant that they could target anyone they saw as a threat to \xe2\x80\x9corder.\xe2\x80\x9d In the\xc2\xa0post-bellum\xc2\xa0South, they enforced white supremacy and largely arrested black people on trumped-up charges in order to feed them into convict labor systems.\nThe violence the police carried out and their moral separation from those they patrolled were not the consequences of the brutality of individual officers, but of policies carefully designed to mold the police into a force that could use violence to deal with the social problems that accompanied the development of a wage-labor economy. For instance, in the short, sharp depression of the\xc2\xa0mid-1880s, Chicago was filled with prostitutes who worked the streets. Many policemen recognized that these prostitutes were generally impoverished women seeking a way to survive and initially tolerated their behavior. But the police hierarchy insisted that the patrolmen arrest these women, impose fines and drive them off the streets and into brothels, where they could be ignored by some members of the elite and controlled by others. Similarly, in 1885, when Chicago began to experience a wave of strikes, some policemen sympathized with strikers. But once the police hierarchy and the mayor decided to break the strikes, policemen who refused to comply were fired.\nThough some patrolmen tried to be kind and others were openly brutal, police violence in the\xc2\xa01880s\xc2\xa0was not a case of a few bad apples \xe2\x80\x94 and neither is it today.\nMuch has changed since the creation of the police \xe2\x80\x94 most importantly, the influx of black people into Northern cities, the\xc2\xa0mid-20th\xc2\xa0century civil rights movement and the creation of the current system of mass incarceration in part as a response to that movement. But these changes did not lead to a fundamental shift in policing. They led to new policies designed to preserve fundamental continuities. The police were created to use violence to reconcile electoral democracy with industrial capitalism. Today, they are just one part of the \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal justice\xe2\x80\x9d system that plays the same role. Their basic job is to enforce order among those with the most reason to resent the system \xe2\x80\x94 in our society today, disproportionately among poor black people.\nIf there is one positive lesson from the history of policing\xe2\x80\x99s origins, it is that when workers organized, refused to submit or cooperate and caused problems for the city governments, they could force the police to curb the most galling of their activities. The murders of individual police officers, as happened in Chicago on May 3, 1886, and more recently in New York on December 20, 2014, only reinforced calls for harsh repression. But resistance on a mass scale could force the police to hesitate. This happened in Chicago during the early\xc2\xa01880s, when the police pulled back from breaking strikes, hired immigrant officers and tried to re-establish some credibility among the working class after their role in brutally crushing the 1877 upheaval.\nThe police might back off again if the widespread reaction against the killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown,\xc2\xa0Tamir\xc2\xa0Rice and countless others continues. If they do, it will be a victory for those mobilizing today, and will save lives. But as long as this policing system endures, any change in policy will be aimed at keeping the poor in line more effectively.\nA democratic police system in which police are elected by and accountable to the people they patrol is imaginable. But as long as we have an economic and political system that rests on the exploitation of workers and pushes millions of people into poverty, we are unlikely to see policing become any more democratic than the rest of society.\nSam\xc2\xa0Mitrani\xc2\xa0is a professor of history at the College of\xc2\xa0DuPage.
